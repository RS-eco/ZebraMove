abstract = {Communal rangeland management policies in Botswana and Zimbabwe are based on incorrect technical assumptions about the stability of semiarid rangeland, the nature of rangeland degradation, and the benefits of destocking. Consequently, inappropriate policies, stressing the need to destock and stabilise the rangelands, are pursued. Acknowledgement of the great instability but intrinsic resilience of rangeland would encourage the Governments to regard the opportunistic stocking strategies of the agro-pastoralists of the Communal Areas more favourably. However, degradation of rangelands is occurring, although at varying rates. This justifies the promotion of a "tracking strategy', in which livestock densities are encouraged to follow, more closely than at present, variations in rainfall. The establishment of grazing territories controlled by specific "communities' may be a prerequisite for the promotion of the tracking strategy, and for communal rangeland management and improvement. However, the establishment of such territories must take into account social equity, institutional problems and transaction costs, as well as spatial and temporal variation in rangeland resources. -Authors},

abstract = {1. Evaluating landscape connectivity and identifying and protecting corridors for animal movement have become central challenges in applied ecology and conservation. Currently, resource selection analyses are widely used to focus corridor planning where animal movement is predicted to occur. An animal's behavioural state (e.g. foraging, dispersing) is a significant determinant of resource selection patterns, yet has largely been ignored in connectivity assessments. 2. We review 16 years of connectivity studies employing resource selection analysis to evaluate how researchers have incorporated animal behaviour into corridor planning, and highlight promising new approaches for identifying wildlife corridors. To illustrate the importance of behavioural information in such analyses, we present an empirical case study to test behaviour- specific predictions of connectivity with long-distance dispersal movements of African wild dogs Lycaon pictus. We conclude by recommending strategies for developing more realistic connectivity models for future conservation efforts. 3. Our review indicates that most connectivity studies conflate resource selection with connectivity requirements, which may result in misleading estimates of landscape resistance, and lack validation of proposed connectivity models with movement data. 4. Our case study shows that including only directed movement behaviour when measuring resource selection reveals markedly different, and more accurate, connectivity estimates than a model measuring resource selection independent of behavioural state. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results, using African wild dogs as a case study, suggest that resource selection analyses that fail to consider an animal's behavioural state may be insufficient in targeting movement pathways and corridors for protection. This failure may result in misidentification of wildlife corridors and misallocation of limited conservation resources. Our findings underscore the need for considering patterns of animal movement in appropriate behavioural contexts to ensure the effective application of resource selection analyses for corridor planning.},

abstract = {Tropical forest degradation emits carbon at a rate of approximately 0.5 Pgxy(-1), reduces biodiversity, and facilitates forest clearance. Understanding degradation drivers and patterns is therefore crucial to managing forests to mitigate climate change and reduce biodiversity loss. Putative patterns of degradation affecting forest stocks, carbon, and biodiversity have variously been described previously, but these have not been quantitatively assessed together or tested systematically. Economic theory predicts a systematic allocation of land to its highest use value in response to distance from centers of demand. We tested this theory to see if forest exploitation would expand through time and space as concentric waves, with each wave targeting lower value products. We used forest data along a transect from 10 to 220 km from Dar es Salaam (DES), Tanzania, collected at two points in time (1991 and 2005). Our predictions were confirmed: high-value logging expanded 9 kmxy(-1), and an inner wave of lower value charcoal production 2 kmxy(-1). This resource utilization is shown to reduce the public goods of carbon storage and species richness, which significantly increased with each kilometer from DES [carbon, 0.2 Mgxha(-1); 0.1 species per sample area (0.4 ha)]. Our study suggests that tropical forest degradation can be modeled and predicted, with its attendant loss of some public goods. In sub-Saharan Africa, an area experiencing the highest rate of urban migration worldwide, coupled with a high dependence on forest-based resources, predicting the spatiotemporal patterns of degradation can inform policies designed to extract resources without unsustainably reducing carbon storage and biodiversity.},

Our understanding of the effects of landscape heterogeneity on animal movement is still fairly limited as it requires studying the movement of multiple individuals across a variety of environmental conditions. Gaining deeper understanding of the environmental drivers of movement is a crucial component of predictive models of population spread and habitat selection and may help inform management and conservation. In Ontario, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) occur along a wide geographical gradient ranging from the boreal forest to the Hudson Bay floodplains. We used high-resolution GPS data, collected from 114 individuals across a 450000 km(2) area in northern Ontario, to link movement behaviour to underlying local environmental variables associated with habitat permeability, predation risk and forage availability. We show that a great deal of observed variability in movement patterns across space and time can be attributed to local environmental conditions, with residual individual differences that may reflect spatial population structure. We discuss our results in the context of current knowledge of movement and caribou ecology and highlight potential applications of our approach to the study of wide-ranging animals.},

abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) is a useful tool for measuring three-dimensional habitat structure; hence, its use in habitat suitability models has been explored, both as a single resource and in combination with other remote-sensing techniques. Here, we evaluated the suitability of airborne lidar data in comparison with aerial photographs and field surveys for modelling the distribution of an endangered and cryptic forest species, the hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). The study was conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park of southeast Germany. Subsequently, a prediction map for conservation planning was generated for a large area, which encompassed the National Park. We examined the utility of lidar data for generating a hazel grouse distribution model by using machine learning (boosted regression trees), and then compared the results to variables derived from field surveys and aerial photographs, both separately and in combination. The cross-validated discrimination ability of the model was slightly higher when using lidar data (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), 0.79) compared to models using aerial photographs (AUC, 0.75) or field survey data (AUC, 0.78). The predictive performance consistently increased when combining the predictors from different sources, with an AUC of 0.86 being produced in the model combining all three data sources. The three data sources complemented one another, with each data source probably having an advantage at deriving one of three key aspects of the hazel grouse habitat, namely, vertically well-structured forest stands, horizontally mixed successional vegetation stages, and certain deciduous trees as food resources such as mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia). In addition, the diverse lidar metrics might be applied to simultaneously characterize vertically and horizontally well-structured forest stands.We conclude that public available airborne lidar data are a viable source for creating habitat suitability maps for large areas and may have increased utility for detecting forest characteristics and valuable wildlife habitats.},

This association holds for widespread, narrowly endemic, and threatened species and looks set to persist in the face of foreseeable population growth. Our results contradict earlier expectations of low conflict based on the idea that species richness decreases and human impact increases with primary productivity. We find that across Africa, both variables instead exhibit unimodal relationships with productivity. Modifying priority-setting to take account of human density shows that, at this scale, conflicts between conservation and development are not easily avoided, because many densely inhabited grid cells contain species found nowhere else.},

abstract = {1.Global warming and habitat fragmentation impose dramatic and potentially interactive impacts on ecosystems. Warming induces shifts in species' distributions as they track temperature changes, but this can be hindered in fragmented landscapes. Corridors connecting habitat patches might ameliorate the combined effects of fragmentation and global warming. 2.Using novel automated tracking methods, the movement of woodlice (Oniscus asellus) ranging in body size from 15.3 to 108.6 mg was quantified across a temperature range from 15 to 25° C as they moved around an experimental fragmented landscape. We used confirmatory path analysis to test causal effects of temperature and body size on individual movement and corridor crossing rates between two habitat patches. 3.Results showed that woodlice behaved differently in corridors than patches by moving, on average, faster and more often. This is congruent with natural systems where corridors generally provide lower quality habitat than patches. Although metabolic theory suggests positive scaling of movement with body temperature (up to a peak) and body size, we found that corridor crossing rate was i) not directly affected by body size, and ii) negatively influenced by temperature, possibly due to its indirect effects via humidity. 4.Our path model revealed that metabolic scaling could only explain temperature effects on maximum body velocity, but decision-based behaviour explained most variation in corridor crossing rates. This led to direct and indirect effects of temperature and size on individual movement between habitat patches. 5.Our findings suggest that increasing mean global temperatures, coupled with increasing habitat fragmentation, could have synergistic negative impacts on populations through a combination of physiological and behavioural factors that mediate individual responses to temperature and fragmentation.},

abstract = {Terrestrial wildlife migrations, once common, are now rare because of ecosystem fragmentation and uncontrolled hunting. Botswana historically contained migratory populations of many species but habitat fragmentation, especially by fences, has decreased the number and size of many of these populations. During a study investigating herbivore movement patterns in north-west Botswana we recorded a long-distance zebra Equus burchelli antiquorum migration between the Okavango Delta and Makgadikgadi grasslands, a round-trip distance of 588 km; 55{\%} of 11 animals collared in the south-eastern peripheral delta made this journey. This was unexpected as, between 1968 and 2004, the migration could not have followed its present course because of the bisection of the route by a veterinary cordon fence. As little evidence exists to suggest that largescale movements by medium-sized herbivores can be restored, it is of significant interest that this migration was established to the present highly directed route within 4 years of the fence being removed. The success of wildlife corridors, currently being advocated as the best way to reestablish ecosystem connectivity, relies on animals utilizing novel areas by moving between the connected areas. Our findings suggest that medium-sized herbivores may be able to re-establish migrations relatively quickly once physical barriers have been removed and that the success of future system linkages could be increased by utilizing past migratory routes.},

Here, we identify key species movement concepts, including mechanisms, types, and moderators of movement, and review their relevance to (1) national biodiversity policies and strategies, (2) reserve planning and management, (3) threatened species protection and recovery, (4) impact and risk assessments, and (5) the prioritization of restoration actions. Based on the review, and considering recent developments in movement ecology, we provide a new framework that draws links between aspects of movement knowledge that are likely the most relevant to each biodiversity policy category. Our framework also shows that there is substantial opportunity for collaboration between researchers and government decision makers in the use of movement science to promote positive biodiversity outcomes.},

abstract = {Animal migrations span the globe, involving immense numbers of individuals from a wide range of taxa. Migrants transport nutrients, energy, and other organisms as they forage and are preyed upon throughout their journeys. These highly predictable, pulsed movements across large spatial scales render migration a potentially powerful yet underappreciated dimension of biodiversity that is intimately embedded within resident communities. We review examples from across the animal kingdom to distill fundamental processes by which migratory animals influence communities and ecosystems, demonstrating that they can uniquely alter energy flow, food-web topology and stability, trophic cascades, and the structure of metacommunities. Given the potential for migration to alter ecological networks worldwide, we suggest an integrative framework through which community dynamics and ecosystem functioning may explicitly consider animal migrations.},

abstract = {Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data with their long-term (1981-current) global coverage at frequent intervals provide unique opportunities to explore vegetation dynamics related to climate variability, climate change, and land-use driven changes of land cover. Several AVHRR-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets exist, each based on the AVHRR Global Area Coverage archive but differing in their processing to correct for sensor and atmospheric effects. This paper presents a global comparative analysis for the land surface involving four AVHRR-derived NDVI data sets: (1) Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL); (2) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS); (3) Land Long Term Data Record (LTDR) version 3 (V3); and (4) Fourier-Adjustment, Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated Reconstructed (FASIR). Our aims are two-fold: (1) to assess the level of agreement of the medians, trends, and variances, as well as the correlation between the four AVHRR-NDVI data sets from 1982 to 1999; and (2) to independently assess the performance of each AVHRR-NDVI data set, and that of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI, using 11,764 Landsat samples of 20??20km2 located globally covering every major land-cover type. For the AVHRR-NDVI intercomparison equal medians, variance, and trends, and no correlation between all the respective AVHRR-NDVI data sets were found for 9.9{\%}, 45.5{\%}, 48.1{\%} and 38.4{\%} of the total land surface, respectively (p???0.05). For the four AVHRR-NDVI data sets we found: (1) consistent trends for the tundra and particularly Australia; (2) inconsistent trends for Europe, Africa, and the Sahel; and (3) moderately consistent trends for the rest of the terrestrial land surface including North America and China. The PAL and LTDR V3 data sets lack calibration, as evidenced by the presence of apparent trends in desert areas. In the Landsat-NDVI vs. AVHRR-NDVI comparison of absolute values the LTDR V3 data set performed best, whereas in the comparison of temporal-change values the GIMMS data set performed best. In both analyses MODIS-NDVI performed better than any AVHRR-NDVI data set. The simple average of the four AVHRR-NDVI data sets produced better results than either AVHRR-NDVI data set alone, indicating that the errors between the data sets are at least partially unrelated. This research emphasizes the implications of AVHRR-NDVI data set choice for studies assessing the vegetation response to climate change and modeling of the terrestrial carbon balance. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Conservation scientists emphasize the importance of maintaining a connected network of protected areas to prevent ecosystems and populations from becoming isolated, reduce the risk of extinction, and ultimately sustain biodiversity. Keeping protected areas connected in a network is increasingly recognized as a conservation priority in the current era of rapid climate change. Models that identify suitable linkages between core areas have been used to prioritize potentially important corridors for maintaining functional connectivity. Here, we identify the most “natural” (i.e., least human-modified) corridors between large protected areas in the contiguous Unites States. We aggregated results from multiple connectivity models to develop a composite map of corridors reflecting agreement of models run under different assumptions about how human modification of land may influence connectivity. To identify which land units are most important for sustaining structural connectivity, we used the composite map of corridors to evaluate connectivity priorities in two ways: (1) among land units outside of our pool of large core protected areas and (2) among units administratively protected as Inventoried Roadless (IRAs) or Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs). Corridor values varied substantially among classes of “unprotected” non-core land units, and land units of high connectivity value and priority represent diverse ownerships and existing levels of protections. We provide a ranking of IRAs and WSAs that should be prioritized for additional protection to maintain minimal human modification. Our results provide a coarse-scale assessment of connectivity priorities for maintaining a connected network of protected areas.},

abstract = {Among Earth's most stunning, yet imperiled, biological phenomena is long-distance migration (LDM). Although the understanding of how and why animals migrate may be of general interest, few sitespecific strategies have targeted ways in which to best retain such increasingly rare events. Contrasts among 29 terrestrial mammals from five continents representing 103 populations indicate that remnant long-distant migrants have poor long-term prospects. Nonetheless, in areas of low human density in the Western Hemisphere, five social and nongregarious species, all from the same region of the Rocky Mountains (U.S.A.), still experience the most accentuated of remaining New World LDMs south of central Canada. These movements occur in or adjacent to the Greater Yellowstone region, where about 75{\%} of the migration routes for elk (Cervus elaphus), bison ( Bison bison), and North America's sole surviving endemic ungulate, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), have already been lost. However, pronghorn still migrate up to 550 km (round-trip) annually. These extreme movements (1) necessitate use of historic, exceptionally narrow corridors (0.1–0.8 km wide) that have existed for at least 5800 years, (2) exceed travel distances of elephants ( Loxodonta africana) and zebras ( Equus burchelli), and (3) are on par with those of Asian chiru ( Pantholops hodgsoni) and African wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). Although conservation planners face uncertainty in situating reserves in the most biologically valued locations, the concordance between archaeological and current biological data on migration through specific corridors in these unprotected areas adjacent to the Yellowstone system highlights their retention value. It is highly likely that accelerated leasing of public lands for energy development in such regions will truncate such migrations. One landscape-level solution to conserving LDMs is the creation of a network of national migration corridors, an action in the Yellowstone region that would result in de facto protection for a multispecies complex. Tactics applied in this part of the world may not work in others, however, therefore reinforcing the value of site-specific field information on the past and current biological needs of migratory species.},

abstract = {For at least 200 years, Gomoti River people and their neighbours lived interactively with the Okavango flood pulse system, travelling widely in dugout canoes, practicing flood recession agriculture, fishing, hunting, and collecting wild foods. Today they are wetlanders without wetlands. A major outflow channel of the eastern Okavango Delta in the 1930s, the Gomoti River rarely flows these days. This paper explores the Gomoti's demise, through the lenses first of science and second of Gomoti basin residents. Models developed over the past 20 years attribute the Gomoti's drying to a complex set of bio-hydrologic processes and feedback loops that begin with sedimentation and conclude with channel switching, peat fires, and purging of toxic salts. Such models essentially omit the long history of human habitation and ecological interaction with the delta. Local people, on the other hand, tell of deliberate and systematic management of channels and floodplains, and they argue this management kept the river healthy and flowing. The picture is confounded by colonial era interventions and by Botswana government policies partitioning the Gomoti and restricting access to its headwaters. We conclude with a model combining meso-scale scientific explanation with micro-scale indigenous constructions as a context for new thinking about Okavango Delta resource management. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Most animals restrain their movement activities to familiar areas which leads to home ranges. Although understanding both establishment and shifts of home ranges is highly relevant for basic science and conservation, pinpointing the factors that shape the dynamics of home ranges remains a challenge. Evidently home ranges are influenced by the underlying landscape. Landscape composition, i.e., the fraction of different land cover types, has recently been shown to affect home range size. Yet, the explicit spatial configuration of the landscape, a factor which is known to be of central importance in spatial ecology, is not taken into account by most studies. We quantify the effect of landscape configuration on summer home range sizes across multiple spatio-temporal scales using GPS data from two behaviorally distinct ungulate species, red (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. We show that the spatial configuration of the landscape is the dominant factor explaining home range size. Furthermore, we find that the shape of the relationship between home range size and landscape configuration depends on a species' habitat requirements: while roe deer decrease their home range size with increasing landscape patchiness, the relationship is hump-shaped for red deer. Our results are robust at all tested spatio-temporal scales.},

abstract = {Background: Linking animalmovements to landscape features is critical to identify factors that shape the spatial behaviour of animals. Habitat selection is led by behavioural decisions and is shaped by the environment, therefore the landscape is crucial for the analysis. Land cover classification based on ground survey and remote sensing data sets are an established approach to define landscapes for habitat selection analysis. We investigate an approach for analysing habitat use using continuous land cover information and spatial metrics. This approach uses a continuous representation of the landscape using percentage cover of a chosen land cover type instead of discrete classes. This approach, fractional cover, captures spatial heterogeneity within classes and is therefore capable to provide a more distinct representation of the landscape. The variation in home range sizes is analysed using fractional cover and spatial metrics in conjunction with mixed effect models on red deer position data in the Bohemian Forest, compared over multiple spatio–temporal scales. Results: We analysed forest fractional cover and a texture metric within each home range showing that variance of fractional cover values and texture explain much of variation in home range sizes. The results show a hump–shaped relationship, leading to smaller home ranges when forest fractional cover is very homogeneous or highly heterogeneous, while intermediate stages lead to larger home ranges. Conclusion: The application of continuous land cover information in conjunction with spatial metrics proved to be valuable for the explanation of home-range sizes of red deer.},

abstract = {* Impediments to animal movement are ubiquitous and vary widely in both scale and permeability. It is essential to understand how impediments alter ecological dynamics via their influence on animal behavioural strategies governing space use and, for anthropogenic features such as roads and fences, how to mitigate these effects to effectively manage species and landscapes. * Here, we focused primarily on barriers to movement, which we define as features that cannot be circumnavigated but may be crossed. Responses to barriers will be influenced by the movement capabilities of the animal, its proximity to the barriers, and habitat preference. We developed a mechanistic modelling framework for simultaneously quantifying the permeability and proximity effects of barriers on habitat preference and movement. * We used simulations based on our model to demonstrate how parameters on movement, habitat preference and barrier permeability can be estimated statistically. We then applied the model to a case study of road effects on wild mountain reindeer summer movements. * This framework provided unbiased and precise parameter estimates across a range of strengths of preferences and barrier permeabilities. The quality of permeability estimates, however, was correlated with the number of times the barrier is crossed and the number of locations in proximity to barriers. In the case study we found that reindeer avoided areas near roads and that roads are semi-permeable barriers to movement. There was strong avoidance of roads extending up to c. 1 km for four of five animals, and having to cross roads reduced the probability of movement by 68{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (range 3{\textperiodcentered}5–99{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}). * Human infrastructure has embedded within it the idea of networks: nodes connected by linear features such as roads, rail tracks, pipelines, fences and cables, many of which divide the landscape and limit animal movement. The unintended but potentially profound consequences of infrastructure on animals remain poorly understood. The rigorous framework for simultaneously quantifying movement, habitat preference and barrier permeability developed here begins to address this knowledge gap.},

abstract = {Over the last two centuries overhunting, anthropogenic barriers and habitat loss have disrupted many ungulate migrations. We review the literature on ungulate migration disruptions and find that for many species the disruption of migratory routes causes a rapid population collapse. Previous research has focused on the proximal ecological factors that might favour migration, particularly spatiotemporal variation in resources and predation. However, this does not provide an adequate basis for understanding and mitigating anthropogenic effects on migratory populations. Migration is a complex behaviour and we advocate an integrative approach that incorporates population dynamics, evolution, genetics, behaviour and physiology, and that borrows insights and approaches from research on other taxa. We draw upon research on avian migration to illustrate research approaches that might also be fruitful in ungulates. In particular, we suggest that the migratory cycle should be evaluated in the context of seasonal population limitation, an approach we highlight with a preliminary demographic perturbation analysis of the Serengeti wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) population. We provide suggestions for avenues of future research and highlight areas where we believe rapid progress can be made by applying recent advances in theory, technology and analytical approaches.},

abstract = {The socioeconomic impact of protected areas, crucial to conservation, has been investigated mainly in low-income, highly biodiverse, contexts. However, studies are needed on the impact of protected areas in high-income places managed for millennia. This work evidences spatial relationships of protected areas and human well-being changes in a highly biodiverse area of southern Spain. We calculated well-being using a synthetic indicator (called the P{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} distance) that integrates information from 22 socioeconomic variables using an iterative procedure to weight the input variables. We used 22 variables to describe well-being according to the categories proposed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. The results reveal significant increases in well-being in Andalusian municipalities between 1989 (when these protected areas were designated) and 2009. This increase was significantly higher in municipalities within protected areas. We also found that a protected municipality increases in well-being irrespective of the size of the protected area encompassing it or the areal percentage covered by the protected area. These results strongly evidence a spatial correspondence between protected areas and improvement of the well-being of local municipalities in areas with long histories of human management.},

abstract = {Home range behaviour is a common pattern of space use, having fundamental consequences for ecological processes. However, a general mechanistic explanation is still lacking. Research is split into three separate areas of inquiry - movement models based on random walks, individual-based models based on optimal foraging theory, and a statistical modelling approach - which have developed without much productive contact. Here we review recent advances in modelling home range behaviour, focusing particularly on the problem of identifying mechanisms that lead to the emergence of stable home ranges from unbounded movement paths. We discuss the issue of spatiotemporal scale, which is rarely considered in modelling studies, as well as highlighting the need to consider more closely the dynamical nature of home ranges. Recent methodological and theoretical advances may soon lead to a unified approach, however, conceptually unifying our understanding of linkages among home range behaviour and ecological or evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {* Habitats have substantial influence on the distribution and abundance of animals. Animals' selective movement yields their habitat use. Animals generally are more abundant in habitats that are selected most strongly. * Models of habitat selection can be used to distribute animals on the landscape or their distribution can be modelled based on data of habitat use, occupancy, intensity of use or counts of animals. When the population is at carrying capacity or in an ideal-free distribution, habitat selection and related metrics of habitat use can be used to estimate abundance. * If the population is not at equilibrium, models have the flexibility to incorporate density into models of habitat selection; but abundance might be influenced by factors influencing fitness that are not directly related to habitat thereby compromising the use of habitat-based models for predicting population size. * Scale and domain of the sampling frame, both in time and space, are crucial considerations limiting application of these models. Ultimately, identifying reliable models for predicting abundance from habitat data requires an understanding of the mechanisms underlying population regulation and limitation.},

abstract = {A resource selection function (RSF) is any model that yields values proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit. RSF models often are fitted using generalized linear models (GLMs) although a variety of statistical models might be used. Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are tools that can be useful for selecting a model from a set of biologically plausible candidates. Statistical inference procedures, such as the likelihood-ratio test, can be used to assess whether models deviate from random null models. But for most applications of RSF models, usefulness is evaluated by how well the model predicts the location of organisms on a landscape. Predictions from RSF models constructed using presence/absence (used/unused) data can be evaluated using procedures developed for logistic regression, such as confusion matrices, Kappa statistics, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. However, RSF models estimated from presence/available data create unique problems for evaluating model predictions. For presence/available models we propose a form of k-fold cross validation for evaluating prediction success. This involves calculating the correlation between RSF ranks and area-adjusted frequencies for a withheld sub-sample of data. A similar approach can be applied to evaluate predictive success for out-of-sample data. Not all RSF models are robust for application in different times or different places due to ecological and behavioral variation of the target organisms. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Land and natural resource conservation programs are increasingly being evaluated on the basis of their return on investment (ROI). Conservation ROI analysis quantitatively measures the costs, benefits, and risks of investments, which allows conservation organizations to rank or prioritize them. This article surveys the literature in this area. We organize our discussion around the way studies treat the core elements of ROI, which include the definition and measurement of the conservation objective, identification of relevant baselines, the types of conservation investments considered, and investment costs. We discuss the state of the art of ROI analysis, highlight some unresolved issues, and make suggestions for improvements. We also describe options for extending ROI analysis beyond biodiversity conservation, which is the typical objective. The literature indicates that conservation planning that uses ROI analysis can considerably alter the location and targets of conservation, lead to more protection and higher quality conservation outcomes, and result in significant savings. The measurement and prediction of baseline ecological conditions and threats remains a central challenge for conservation ROI analysis, as does accounting for landowner and developer responses to conservation investments. Another key priority for future research is the identification of ways to more comprehensively incorporate ecosystem services and multiple environmental objectives into the assessment framework.

abstract = {Habitat corridors are important tools for maintaining connectivity in increasingly fragmented landscapes, but generally they have been considered in single-species approaches. Corridors intended to facilitate the movement of multiple species could increase persistence of entire communities, but at the likely cost of being less efficient for any given species than a corridor intended specifically for that species. There have been few tests of the trade-offs between single- and multispecies corridor approaches. We assessed single-species and multispecies habitat corridors for 5 threatened mammal species in tropical forests of Borneo. We generated maps of the cost of movement across the landscape for each species based on the species' local abundance as estimated through hierarchical modeling of camera-trap data with biophysical and anthropogenic covariates. Elevation influenced local abundance of banded civets (Hemigalus derbyanus) and sun bears (Helarctos malayanus). Increased road density was associated with lower local abundance of Sunda clouded leopards (Neofelis diardi) and higher local abundance of sambar deer (Rusa unicolor). Pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) local abundance was lower in recently logged areas. An all-species-combined connectivity scenario with least-cost paths and 1 km buffers generated total movement costs that were 27{\{}{\%}{\}} and 23{\{}{\%}{\}} higher for banded civets and clouded leopards, respectively, than the connectivity scenarios for those species individually. A carnivore multispecies connectivity scenario, however, increased movement cost by 2{\{}{\%}{\}} for banded civets and clouded leopards. Likewise, an herbivore multispecies scenario provided more effective connectivity than the all-species-combined scenario for sambar and macaques. We suggest that multispecies habitat connectivity plans be tailored to groups of ecologically similar, disturbance-sensitive species to maximize their effectiveness.},

abstract = {We investigated how plains zebras moved across a large natural landscape by analysing the movement paths of nine zebra mares foraging out from spatially confined waterholes during the dry season in the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park, Botswana. Since it was essential to investigate directed movement over a range of spatial scales to determine the correct movement behaviour and strategy, we used Nams's scaling test for oriented movement. Zebras followed directed movement paths in the lower to medium spatial scales (10 m-3.7 km) and above their visual, and possibly olfactory, range. The spatial scale of directed movement suggests that zebras had a well-defined spatial awareness and cognitive ability. Seven zebras used directed movement paths, but the remaining two followed paths not significantly different to a correlated random walk (CRW). At large spatial scales ({\textgreater}3 km) no distinct movement pattern could be identified and paths could not be distinguished from a CRW. Foraging strategy affected the extent of directed movement: zebras with a confined dispersion of grazing patches around the central place directed their movements over a longer distance. Zebras may extend the distance at which they can direct their movement after improving their knowledge of the local environment. ?? 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Abstract: Nearly half the world's vascular plant species and one-third of terrestrial vertebrates are endemic to 25 “hotspots” of biodiversity, each of which has at least 1500 endemic plant species. None of these hotspots have more than one-third of their pristine habitat remaining. Historically, they covered 12{\%} of the land's surface, but today their intact habitat covers only 1.4{\%} of the land. As a result of this habitat loss, we expect many of the hotspot endemics to have either become extinct or—because much of the habitat loss is recent—to be threatened with extinction. We used World Conservation Union [ IUCN ] Red Lists to test this expectation. Overall, between one-half and two-thirds of all threatened plants and 57{\%} of all threatened terrestrial vertebrates are hotspot endemics. For birds and mammals, in general, predictions of extinction in the hotspots based on habitat loss match numbers of species independently judged extinct or threatened. In two classes of hotspots the match is not as close. On oceanic islands, habitat loss underestimates extinction because introduced species have driven extinctions beyond those caused by habitat loss on these islands. In large hotspots, conversely, habitat loss overestimates extinction, suggesting scale dependence (this effect is also apparent for plants). For reptiles, amphibians, and plants, many fewer hotspot endemics are considered threatened or extinct than we would expect based on habitat loss. This mismatch is small in temperate hotspots, however, suggesting that many threatened endemic species in the poorly known tropical hotspots have yet to be included on the IUCN Red Lists. We then asked in which hotspots the consequences of further habitat loss (either absolute or given current rates of deforestation) would be most serious. Our results suggest that the Eastern Arc and Coastal Forests of Tanzania-Kenya, Philippines, and Polynesia-Micronesia can least afford to lose more habitat and that, if current deforestation rates continue, the Caribbean, Tropical Andes, Philippines, Mesoamerica, Sundaland, Indo-Burma, Madagascar, and Choc{\'{o}}–Dari{\'{e}}n–Western Ecuador will lose the most species in the near future. Without urgent conservation intervention, we face mass extinctions in the hotspots.

En ninguno de estos sitios permanece m{\'{a}}s de un tercio de su h{\'{a}}bitat pr{\'{i}}stino. Hist{\'{o}}ricamente, cubr{\'{i}}an 12{\%} de la superficie terrestre, pero en la actualidad su h{\'{a}}bitat intacto cubre solo 1.4{\%} del terreno. Como resultado de esta p{\'{e}}rdida de h{\'{a}}bitat esperamos que muchas de las especies end{\'{e}}micas a estos sitios est{\'{e}}n extintas o – porque la p{\'{e}}rdida de h{\'{a}}bitat es reciente – se encuentren amenazadas de extinci{\'{o}}n. Utilizamos Listas Rojas de UICN para comprobar esta predicci{\'{o}}n. En general, entre la mitad y dos tercios de las plantas amenazadas y el 57{\%} de los vertebrados terrestres amenazados son end{\'{e}}micos de {\'{a}}reas cr{\'{i}}ticas para la biodiversidad. Para aves y mam{\'{i}}feros en general, las predicciones de extinci{\'{o}}n en las {\'{a}}reas cr{\'{i}}ticas para la biodiversidad, basadas en la p{\'{e}}rdida de h{\'{a}}bitat, coinciden con el n{\'{u}}mero de especies consideradas extintas o amenazadas independientemente. En dos clases de {\'{a}}reas cr{\'{i}}ticas para la biodiversidad la coincidencia no es muy grande. En islas oce{\'{a}}nicas, la p{\'{e}}rdida de h{\'{a}}bitat subestima la extinci{\'{o}}n porque las especies introducidas han causado m{\'{a}}s extinciones que las producidas por la reducci{\'{o}}n del h{\'{a}}bitat. Por lo contrario, la p{\'{e}}rdida de h{\'{a}}bitat sobrestima la extinci{\'{o}}n en {\'{a}}reas cr{\'{i}}ticas para la biodiversidad extensas, lo que sugiere una dependencia de escala (este efecto tambi{\'{e}}n es aparente para plantas). Para reptiles, anfibios y plantas mucho menos especies end{\'{e}}micas son consideradas amenazadas o extintas por p{\'{e}}rdida de h{\'{a}}bitat. Sin embargo, esta discordancia es peque{\~{n}}a en {\'{a}}reas cr{\'{i}}ticas para la biodiversidad en zonas templadas templadas, lo que sugiere que muchas especies end{\'{e}}micas amenazadas en las poco conocidas {\'{a}}reas cr{\'{i}}ticas para la biodiversidad en zonas tropicales aun est{\'{a}}n por incluirse en las Listas Rojas.

Within this framework our approach combines semi-empirical modelling and information theory to identify the best models. Results Woody community structure across African savannas is best represented by a sigmoidal response of tree cover to mean annual precipitation (MAP), with a dependency on soil texture, which is modified by the separate effects of fire, domestic livestock, human population density and cultivation intensity. This model explains c . 66{\%} of the variance in tree cover and appears consistent across the savanna regions of Africa.},

abstract = {Among the main effects of human activities on the environment are land use and resulting land cover changes. Such changes impact the capacity of ecosystems to provide goods and services to the human society. This supply of multiple goods and services by nature should match the demands of the society, if self-sustaining human-environmental systems and a sustainable utilization of natural capital are to be achieved. To describe respective states and dynamics, appropriate indicators and data for their quantification, including quantitative and qualitative assessments, are needed. By linking land cover information from, e.g. remote sensing, land survey and GIS with data from monitoring, statistics, modeling or interviews, ecosystem service supply and demand can be assessed and transferred to different spatial and temporal scales. The results reveal patterns of human activities over time and space as well as the capacities of different ecosystems to provide ecosystem services under changing land use. Also the locations of respective demands for these services can be determined. As maps are powerful tools, they hold high potentials for visualization of complex phenomena. We present an easy-to-apply concept based on a matrix linking spatially explicit biophysical landscape units to ecological integrity, ecosystem service supply and demand. An exemplary application for energy supply and demand in a central German case study region and respective maps for the years 1990 and 2007 are presented. Based on these data, the concept for an appropriate quantification and related spatial visualization of ecosystem service supply and demand is elaborated and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {(i) Anthropogenic pressures, including climate change, are causing nonlinear changes in ecosystems globally. The development of reliable early warning indicators (EWIs) to predict these changes is vital for the adaptive management of ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity, natural capital and ecosystem services. Increased variance and autocorrelation are potential early warning indicators and can be readily estimated from ecological time series. Here, we undertook a comprehensive test of the consistency between early warning indicators and nonlinear abundance change across species, trophic levels and ecosystem types. We tested whether long-term abundance time series of 55 taxa (126 data sets) across multiple trophic levels in marine and freshwater ecosystems showed (i) significant nonlinear change in abundance ‘turning points' and (ii) significant increases in variance and autocorrelation (‘early warning indicators'). For each data set, we then quantified the prevalence of three cases: true positives (early warning indicators and associated turning point), false negatives (turning point but no associated early warning indicators) and false positives (early warning indicators but no turning point). True positives were rare, representing only 9{\{}{\%}{\}} (16 of 170) of cases using variance, and 13{\{}{\%}{\}} (19 of 152) of cases using autocorrelation. False positives were more prevalent than false negatives (53{\{}{\%}{\}} vs. 38{\{}{\%}{\}} for variance; 47{\{}{\%}{\}} vs. 40{\{}{\%}{\}} for autocorrelation). False results were found in every decade and across all trophic levels and ecosystems. Time series that contained true positives were uncommon (8{\{}{\%}{\}} for variance; 6{\{}{\%}{\}} for autocorrelation), with all but one time series also containing false classifications. Coherence between the types of early warning indicators was generally low with 43{\{}{\%}{\}} of time series categorized differently based on variance compared to autocorrelation. Synthesis and applications. Conservation management requires effective early warnings of ecosystem change using readily available data, and variance and autocorrelation in abundance data have been suggested as candidates. However, our study shows that they consistently fail to predict nonlinear change. For early warning indicators to be effective tools for preventative management of ecosystem change, we recommend that multivariate approaches of a suite of potential indicators are adopted, incorporating analyses of anthropogenic drivers and process-based understanding.},

We envision an exciting synergy between animal ecology and GPS-based radiotelemetry, as for other examples of new technologies stimulating rapid conceptual advances, where research opportunities have been paralleled by technical and analytical challenges. Animal positions provide the elemental unit of movement paths and show where individuals interact with the ecosystems around them. We discuss how knowing where animals go can help scientists in their search for a mechanistic understanding of key concepts of animal ecology, including resource use, home range and dispersal, and population dynamics. It is probable that in the not-so-distant future, intense sampling of movements coupled with detailed information on habitat features at a variety of scales will allow us to represent an animal's cognitive map of its environment, and the intimate relationship between behaviour and fitness. An extended use of these data over long periods of time and over large spatial scales can provide robust inferences for complex, multi-factorial phenomena, such as meta-analyses of the effects of climate change on animal behaviour and distribution.},

abstract = {* Decreasing rate of migration in several species as a consequence of climate change and anthropic pressure, together with increasing evidence of space-use strategies intermediate between residency and complete migration, are very strong motivations to evaluate migration occurrence and features in animal populations. * The main goal of this paper was to perform a relative comparison between methods for identifying and characterizing migration at the individual and population level on the basis of animal location data. * We classified 104 yearly individual trajectories from five populations of three deer species as migratory or non-migratory, by means of three methods: seasonal home range overlap, spatio-temporal separation of seasonal clusters and the Net Squared Displacement (NSD) method. For migratory cases, we also measured timing and distance of migration and residence time on the summer range. Finally, we compared the classification in migration cases across methods and populations. * All methods consistently identified migration at the population level, that is, they coherently distinguished between complete or almost complete migratory populations and partially migratory populations. However, in the latter case, methods coherently classified only about 50{\%} of the single cases, that is they classified differently at the individual-animal level. We therefore infer that the comparison of methods may help point to ‘less-stereotyped' cases in the residency-to-migration continuum. For cases consistently classified by all methods, no significant differences were found in migration distance, or residence time on summer ranges. Timing of migration estimated by NSD was earlier than by the other two methods, both for spring and autumn migrations. * We suggest three steps to identify improper inferences from migration data and to enhance understanding of intermediate space-use strategies. We recommend (i) classifying migration behaviours using more than one method, (ii) performing sensitivity analysis on method parameters to identify the extent of the differences and (iii) investigating inconsistently classified cases as these may often be ecologically interesting (i.e. less-stereotyped migratory behaviours).},

abstract = {Urbanisation often has profound impacts on ecological processes. Management of these impacts is central to urban conservation efforts. We used data from 6591 individually ringed weaver birds from 42 ringing locations to investigate the influence that the urban matrix, as well as patch isolation, size and quality, had on weaver bird movement between ringing locations in Cape Town, a growing city within a global biodiversity hotspot. Distance-based linear models revealed that proximity to other sites was the dominant predictor of weaver movement while the site variables (wetland size and bird abundance) had a limited and inconclusive influence. Once the variation explained by the proximity and site variables had been accounted for, the composition of the surrounding urban matrix, the length of the least cost path between wetlands, and the presence of rivers as potential movement corridors (measured at three spatial scales) all had little influence on weaver movement. Analysis of the weaver bird movement-wetland network using social network analysis showed that the network is simple, clustered, and non-random, with relatively high vulnerability to node loss and some indication of preferential attachment (i.e., increased use of more used sites). Since proximity (site isolation) is the dominant influence on weaver movements, and the network is already sparse, further wetland loss is likely to reduce population viability. Our results match the predictions of classical theory and suggest that patch management will matter more for wetland passerines than matrix management.},

At four seasons over one year, wildebeest, zebra and kongoni (Coke's hartebeest) were taken. Stomach materials and faeces were sampled from each animal. Faecal samples were collected from cattle that had been grazing in the same area. Simultaneously, vegetation availability assessments were made. A comparison of techniques for determining the food selectivity indicates that faecal and stomach-content analyses provide similar results when the diets are almost entirely grass. The selectivity exhibited by the four herbivores was determined by faecal analyses. Three grass species were preponderant in all diets as well as in the available menu. In comparing the selectivity shown for the three dominant grasses there is a high degree of similarity even though statistical differences are demonstrated. All animals favoured Themeda triandra over Pennisetum mezianum and Digitaria macroblephara. Kongoni displayed the highest degree of selectivity and cattle and zebra had the greatest similarity in diets. Each animal species had a wide spectrum of grasses in their diets: these contained a greater number of species during the drier seasons than during the rainy seasons. Wild animals had a greater diet variation between seasons than did cattle, the diet of the latter remaining much more consistent than the combination of available grasses.},

abstract = {Planning for the remediation of multiple threats is crucial to ensure the long term persistence of biodiversity. Limited conservation budgets require prioritizing which management actions to implement and where. Systematic conservation planning traditionally assumes that all the threats in priority sites are abated (fixed prioritization approach). However, abating only the threats affecting the species of conservation concerns may be more cost-effective. This requires prioritizing individual actions independently within the same site (independent prioritization approach), which has received limited attention so far. We developed an action prioritization algorithm that prioritizes multiple alternative actions within the same site. We used simulated annealing to find the combination of actions that remediate threats to species at the minimum cost. Our algorithm also accounts for the importance of selecting actions in sites connected through the river network (i.e., connectivity). We applied our algorithm to prioritize actions to address threats to freshwater fish species in the Mitchell River catchment, northern Australia. We compared how the efficiency of the independent and fixed prioritization approach varied as the importance of connectivity increased. Our independent prioritization approach delivered more efficient solutions than the fixed prioritization approach, particularly when the importance of achieving connectivity was high. By spatially prioritizing the specific actions necessary to remediate the threats affecting the target species, our approach can aid cost-effective habitat restoration and land-use planning. It is also particularly suited to solving resource allocation problems, where consideration of spatial design is important, such as prioritizing conservation efforts for highly mobile species, species facing climate change-driven range shifts, or minimizing the risk of threats spreading across different realms.},

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat, can occur at multiple spatial scales at the same time, as a result of different land uses. Individuals of most species spend different amounts of times moving in different modes, during which they cover different distances and experience different fitness impacts. The scale at which fragmentation occurs interacts with the distance that individuals move in a particular mode to affect an individual's ability to find habitat. However, there is little knowledge of the fitness consequences of different scales of fragmentation for individuals with different traits of movement behaviour. This is critical to understand the mechanisms of persistence of different species in fragmented landscapes. The aim of this study is to quantify the impacts of habitat fragmentation at different scales on the fitness components (reproduction and survival) of individuals with different traits of movement behaviour. We developed a demographic model of individuals that adopt short and tortuous movements within foraging areas (foraging mode) and long and straight movements between foraging areas (searching mode). We considered individuals that adopt different movement modes with varying frequencies, inherently move different searching distances and experience different risks of mortality during searching. We then applied the model within a spatially-explicit simulation framework where we varied simultaneously the degree of fragmentation within (fine scale) and between foraging areas (coarse scale). Fine-scale fragmentation had a greater impact on reproduction and survival than coarse-scale fragmentation, for those individuals with a low searching propensity. The impact of fine-scale fragmentation on reproduction and survival interacted with the impact of coarse-scale fragmentation on reproduction and survival, to affect the fitness of individuals with a high searching propensity, large inherent searching distances and high searching mortality rates. Habitat selection strongly mitigated the impact of the scale at which fragmentation occurred on individual fitness. Our findings suggest that the land use to target with conservation actions to reduce fragmentation, such as financial schemes that promote re-vegetation or retention of standing vegetation, depends on the scale at which fragmentation occurs and the movement behaviour traits of the species of conservation concern.

abstract = {There are now over 100000 protected areas worldwide, covering over 12{\%} of the Earth's land surface. These areas represent one of the most significant human resource use allocations on the planet. The importance of protected areas is reflected in their widely accepted role as an indicator for global targets and environmental assessments. However, measuring the number and extent of protected areas only provides a unidimensional indicator of political commitment to biodiversity conservation. Data on the geographic location and spatial extent of protected areas will not provide information on a key determinant for meeting global biodiversity targets: 'effectiveness' in conserving biodiversity. Although tools are being devised to assess management effectiveness, there is no globally accepted metric. Nevertheless, the numerical, spatial and geographic attributes of protected areas can be further enhanced by investigation of the biodiversity coverage of these protected areas, using species, habitats or biogeographic classifications. This paper reviews the current global extent of protected areas in terms of geopolitical and habitat coverage, and considers their value as a global indicator of conservation action or response. The paper discusses the role of the World Database on Protected Areas and collection and quality control issues, and identifies areas for improvement, including how conservation effectiveness indicators may be included in the database to improve the value of protected areas data as an indicator for meeting global biodiversity targets.},

abstract = {Partial migration, where populations of animals are composed of a mixture of resident and migratory individuals, is a widespread phenomenon in nature. It has been reported to occur in all major vertebrate groups, and can have significant ecological consequences. Here we give an overview of the ecology and evolution of partial migration in animals. We firstly review the different types of partial migration, and assess the ecological drivers responsible for driving individual differences in migratory tendency within populations. A variety of factors can be important in promoting the evolution of partial migration, including competition for resources or breeding opportunities, predation risk and intraspecific niche diversity. Often various factors act synergistically to create complex patterns of movement polymorphism within populations. The question of how partial migration is maintained over evolutionary timescales is also addressed. Whilst many theoretical considerations of partial migration utilise an evolutionary stable state (ESS) paradigm, empirical evidence for this is lacking. Rather the evidence suggests that partial migration is mostly condition dependent, and the optimum outcome for an individual is dependent upon its phenotype. What determines whether an individual follows a migratory or resident strategy is discussed in light of new theory and empirical data which supports the idea that environmentally responsive genetic thresholds are important across a range of species, from birds to fish, in proximately shaping migratory tendency. Finally we espouse our vision of how partial migration research will develop in the future, and suggest a number of exciting directions that studies into migratory dimorphism may take in the coming years.},

Instead, corridor designs often are based on binary patterns of habitat suitability. New technologies and analytical tools make it possible to better integrate landscape patterns with behavioral processes. We show how resource selection functions can be used to describe habitat suitability with continuous and multivariable metrics and review methods by which animal movement can be quantified, analyzed, and modeled. We then show how the processes of habitat selection and movement can be integrated with landscape features using least-cost paths, graph theory, and step selection functions. These tools offer new ways to design, implement, and study corridors as landscape linkages more objectively and holistically.},

At low leaf biomass sites there was reasonable agreement between MODIS and BigFoot LAI products, but there was not a particular MODIS LAI algorithm pathway that consistently compared most favorably. At high leaf biomass sites, MODIS LAI was generally overpredicted by a significant amount. For evergreen needleleaf sites, LAI seasonality was exaggerated by MODIS.

abstract = {Remote measurement of the physiology, behaviour and energetic status of free-living animals is made possible by a variety of techniques that we refer to collectively as 'biotelemetry'. This set of tools ranges from transmitters that send their signals to receivers up to a few kilometers away to those that send data to orbiting satellites and, more frequently, to devices that log data. They enable researchers to document, for long uninterrupted periods, how undisturbed organisms interact with each other and their environment in real time. In spite of advances enabling the monitoring of many physiological and behavioural variables across a range of taxa of various sizes, these devices have yet to be embraced widely by the ecological community. Our review suggests that this technology has immense potential for research in basic and applied animal ecology. Efforts to incorporate biotelemetry into broader ecological research programs should yield novel information that has been challenging to collect historically from free-ranging animals in their natural environments. Examples of research that would benefit from biotelemetry include the assessment of animal responses to different anthropogenic perturbations and the development of life-time energy budgets.},

To reach this aim a high-level understanding of the distribution and conditions of these habitats is needed. Remote sensing can considerably contribute to habitat mapping and their observation over time. Several European projects and a large number of scientific studies have addressed the issue of mapping and monitoring natural habitats via remote sensing and the deriving of indicators on their conservation status. The multitude of utilized remote sensing sensors and applied methods used in these studies, however, impede a common understanding of what is achievable with current state-of-the-art technologies. The aim of this paper is to provide a synthesis on what is currently feasible in terms of detection and monitoring of natural and semi-natural habitats with remote sensing. To focus this endeavour, we concentrate on those studies aimed at direct mapping of individual habitat types or discriminating between different types of habitats occurring in relatively large, spatially contiguous units. By this we uncover the potential of remote sensing to better understand the distribution of habitats and the assessment of their conservation status in Europe.},

abstract = {Hybridization between an abundant species and an endangered species is cause for concern. When such hybridization is observed, it is both urgent and necessary to assess the level of threat posed to the endangered species. We report the first evidence of natural hybridization between two equids: the endangered Grevy's zebra Equus grevyi and the abundant plains zebra Equus burchelli. Grevy's zebra now number 3000 individuals globally, and occur only in northern Kenya and Ethiopia. In recent years, Grevy's zebra have become increasingly concentrated in the south of their range due to habitat loss in the north. Both species are sympatric in the Laikipia ecosystem of northern Kenya, where we have observed purportedly hybrid individuals. Using mitochondrial and Y chromosome DNA, we confirmed the hybrid status of the morphologically identified hybrids and demonstrate conclusively that all first-generation hybrids are the offspring of plains zebra females and Grevy's zebra males. Behaviorally, hybrids integrate themselves into plains zebra society, rather than adopting the social organization of Grevy's zebra. Two hybrids have successfully raised foals to over 3 months in age, including one which has reached adulthood, indicating the fertility of female hybrids and viability of their offspring. We hypothesize that hybridization occurs due to (1) skewed sex ratios, in favor of males, within Grevy's zebra and (2) the numerical dominance of plains zebra in the region where hybridization is occurring. Stakeholders have discussed hybridization as a potential threat to Grevy's zebra survival. We argue, however, based on behavioral observations, that hybridization is unlikely to dilute the Grevy's zebra gene pool in the short term. As a conservation concern, hybridization is secondary to more direct causes of Grevy's zebra declines.},

The potential ecological consequences of such habitat fragmentation include reduction of gene flow between subpopulations and hence an increase in genetic differentiation and a decrease in genetic diversity. Among the solutions to provide connectivity between patches isolated by roads, wildlife overpasses are one of the most expensive alternatives. Despite the high costs associated with their construction, most of the studies assessing their use by wildlife remain observational, reporting evidence for passage use but few data on the number of individual crossings. Moreover, the use itself of wildlife overpasses does not appear sufficient to assess their effectiveness from a genetic viewpoint because a minimum number of individuals is required to assure gene flow between population patches and because the spatiotemporal dimension of individual movements and demographic parameters of subpopulations must be considered. So far, there is no evidence that wildlife overpasses do or do not efficiently address genetic issues. This lack of data is probably due to the fact that few mitigation efforts have implemented monitoring programs that incorporate sufficient experimental designs into pre- and postconstruction evaluation. To assess the genetic effectiveness of wildlife overpasses, long-term monitoring programs, including fieldwork and genetic analyses, are needed.},

abstract = {1. Physical barriers contribute to habitat fragmentation, influence species distribution and ranging behaviour, and impact long-term population viability. Barrier permeability varies among species and can potentially impact the competitive balance within animal communities by differentially affecting co-occurring species. The influence of barriers on the spatial distribution of species within whole communities has nonetheless received little attention. 2. During a 4-year period, we studied the influence of a fence and rivers, two landscape features that potentially act as barriers on space use and ranging behaviour of lions Panthera leo, spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta, African wild dogs Lycaon pictus and cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus in Northern Botswana. We compared the tendencies of these species to cross the barriers using data generated from GPS-radio collars fitted to a total of 35 individuals. Barrier permeability was inferred by calculating the number of times animals crossed a barrier vs. the number of times they did not cross. Finally, based on our results, we produced a map of connectivity for the broader landscape system. 3. Permeability varied significantly between fence and rivers and among species. The fence represented an obstacle for lions (permeability = 7.2{\%}), while it was considerably more permeable for hyenas (35.6{\%}) and wild dogs and cheetahs (≥ 50{\%}). In contrast, the rivers and associated floodplains were relatively permeable to lions (14.4{\%}) while they represented a nearly impassable obstacle for the other species ({\textless}2{\%}). 4. The aversion of lions to cross the fence resulted in a relatively lion-free habitat patch on one side of the fence, which might provide a potential refuge for other species. For instance, the competitively inferior wild dogs used this refuge significantly more intensively than the side of the fence with a high presence of lions. 5. We showed that the influence of a barrier on the distribution of animals could potentially result in a broad-scale modification of community structure and ecology within a guild of co-occurring species. As habitat fragmentation increases, understanding the impact of barriers on species distributions is thus essential for the implementation of landscape-scale management strategies, the development and maintenance of corridors and the enhancement of connectivity.},

Here, we address this gap using a new database of 583 population abundance time series for 69 species of large mammals in 78 African PAs. Population abundance time series were aggregated to form a multi-species index of overall change in population abundance. The index reveals on average a 59{\%} decline in population abundance between 1970 and 2005. Indices for different parts of Africa demonstrate large regional differences, with southern African PAs typically maintaining their populations and western African PAs suffering the most severe declines. These results indicate that African PAs have generally failed to mitigate human-induced threats to African large mammal populations, but they also show some successes. Further development of our index could help to measure future progress towards post-2010 targets for reducing biodiversity loss. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Of these trees, approximately 1.39 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions and 0.61 trillion in temperate regions. Biome-level trends in tree density demonstrate the importance of climate and topography in controlling local tree densities at finer scales, as well as the overwhelming effect of humans across most of the world.

This study set out to: (1) evaluate land-cover changes and patch fragmentation in a landscape containing sacred and non-sacred forest patches over 15 years and (2) compare the effects at an individual patch level between sacred and non-sacred forests. Past changes in area and patch fragmentation of land cover classes and individual forest patches in the Gamo Highlands, Ethiopia, were assessed using maximum-likelihood classification of LANDSAT images. Large changes in land-cover occurred during 1995-2010, with 109.4{\%} increase in area of farm and settlement and 36.6{\%} decrease of forest area, with a decrease in number of forest patches by 16.1{\%}, mean size by 26.8{\%}, edge density by 29.1{\%} and shape index by 13.3{\%}. While all four individually studied non-sacred forests decreased in size over this period only four of the six individual sacred forests patches showed reduction in area. Forest patches with sacred status had greater protection by local communities than non-sacred forests in the Gamo Highlands. However, their small size and increasing edge density indicate high vulnerability, especially if an erosion of traditional cultural values reduces their protection.},

abstract = {Agricultural land use is a main driver of global biodiversity loss. The assessment of land use impacts in decision-support tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA) requires spatially explicit models, but existing approaches are either not spatially differentiated or modeled at very coarse scales (e.g., biomes or ecoregions). In this paper, we develop a high-resolution (900 m) assessment method for land use impacts on biodiversity based on habitat suitability models (HSM) of mammal species. This method considers potential land use effects on individual species, and impacts are weighted by the species' conservation status and global rarity. We illustrate the method using a case study of crop production in East Africa, but the underlying HSMs developed by the Global Mammals Assessment are available globally. We calculate impacts of three major export crops and compare the results to two previously developed methods (focusing on local and regional impacts, respectively) to assess the relevance of the methodological innovations proposed in this paper. The results highlight hotspots of product-related biodiversity impacts that help characterize the links among agricultural production, consumption, and biodiversity loss.},

abstract = {Elephants live in heterogeneous landscapes where their search for resources may increase individual survival. The uneven distribution of such resources may be linked to landscape heterogeneity. We therefore hypothesized that landscape heterogeneity determines elephant home range location and size in Etosha National Park, Khaudum Game Reserve and Ngamiland District 11. We used landscape maps to quantify landscape heterogeneity based on five metrics calculated using FRAGSTATS and compared these for elephant and randomly located ranges within the study areas. We further related elephant range size to the landscape metrics and water point density. The elephants located their home ranges in areas with relatively high Patch density, Landscape shape index and Shannon diversity index, and relatively low Largest patch index and Contagion. Elephants therefore seem to locate their home ranges in areas of the landscape where higher levels of heterogeneity occur during wet and dry seasons. Home range size decreased with increasing water point density and heterogeneity and water distribution influence elephant space utilisation. Management of elephants should therefore be directed at ensuring the inclusion of heterogeneous landscapes in conservation areas and at reconsidering water management policies that may influence home range sizes and landscape selection. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The densities and survival of many wild animals are presently at risk. Crucial for improving conservation actions is an understanding on a large scale of the relative importance of human and ecological factors in determining the distribution and densities of species. However, even for such charismatic species as the African elephant (Loxodonta africana), spatially explicit, large-scale analyses are lacking, although various local-scale studies are available. Here we show through continent-scale analysis that ecological factors, such as food availability, are correlated with the presence of elephants, but human factors are better predictors of elephant population densities where elephants are present. These densities strongly correlate with conservation policy, literacy rate, corruption and economic welfare, and associate less with the availability of food or water for these animals. Our results suggest that conservation strategies should be organized in a socioeconomic context. The successful conservation of large animal species could depend more on good human education, greater literacy, good governance, and less corruption, than merely setting aside areas for conservation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study, we extend the spatial and temporal extent of a long-term investigation of the relationship of landscape patterns to moose foraging behavior at Isle Royale National Park, {\{}MI.{\}} We examined how patterns of browse availability and consumption, plant basal area, and soil fertility changed during a recent decline in the moose population. We used geostatistics to examine changes in the nature of spatial patterns in two valleys over 18 years and across short-range and long-range distance scales. Landscape patterns of available and consumed browse changed from either repeated patches or randomly distributed patches in 1988--1992 to random point distributions by 2007 after a recent record high peak followed by a rapid decline in the moose population. Patterns of available and consumed browse became decoupled during the moose population low, which is in contrast to coupled patterns during the earlier high moose population. Distributions of plant basal area and soil nitrogen availability also switched from repeated patches to randomly distributed patches in one valley and to random point distributions in the other valley. Rapid declines in moose population density may release vegetation and soil fertility from browsing pressure and in turn create random landscape patterns.},

abstract = {1. Understanding and accurately predicting the spatial patterns of habitat use by organisms is important for ecological research, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. However, this understanding is complicated by the effects of spatial scale, because the scale of analysis affects the quantification of species-environment relationships. 2. We therefore assessed the influence of environmental context (i.e. the characteristics of the landscape surrounding a site), varied over a large range of scales (i.e. ambit radii around focal sites), on the analysis and prediction of habitat selection by African elephants in Kruger National Park, South Africa. 3. We focused on the spatial scaling of the elephants' response to their main resources, forage and water, and found that the quantification of habitat selection strongly depended on the scales at which environmental context was considered. Moreover, the inclusion of environmental context at characteristic scales (i.e. those at which habitat selectivity was maximized) increased the predictive capacity of habitat suitability models. 4. The elephants responded to their environment in a scale-dependent and perhaps hierarchical manner, with forage characteristics driving habitat selection at coarse spatial scales, and surface water at fine spatial scales. 5. Furthermore, the elephants exhibited sexual habitat segregation, mainly in relation to vegetation characteristics. Male elephants preferred areas with high tree cover and low herbaceous biomass, whereas this pattern was reversed for female elephants. 6. We show that the spatial distribution of elephants can be better understood and predicted when scale-dependent species-environment relationships are explicitly considered. This demonstrates the importance of considering the influence of spatial scale on the analysis of spatial patterning in ecological phenomena.},

abstract = {A key measure of humanity's global impact is by how much it has increased species extinction rates. Familiar statements are that these are 100–1000 times pre-human or background extinction levels. Estimating recent rates is straightforward, but establishing a background rate for comparison is not. Previous researchers chose an approximate benchmark of 1 extinction per million species per year (E/MSY). We explored disparate lines of evidence that suggest a substantially lower estimate. Fossil data yield direct estimates of extinction rates, but they are temporally coarse, mostly limited to marine hard-bodied taxa, and generally involve genera not species. Based on these data, typical background loss is 0.01 genera per million genera per year. Molecular phylogenies are available for more taxa and ecosystems, but it is debated whether they can be used to estimate separately speciation and extinction rates. We selected data to address known concerns and used them to determine median extinction estimates from statistical distributions of probable values for terrestrial plants and animals. We then created simulations to explore effects of violating model assumptions. Finally, we compiled estimates of diversification—the difference between speciation and extinction rates for different taxa. Median estimates of extinction rates ranged from 0.023 to 0.135 E/MSY. Simulation results suggested over- and under-estimation of extinction from individual phylogenies partially canceled each other out when large sets of phylogenies were analyzed. There was no evidence for recent and widespread pre-human overall declines in diversity. This implies that average extinction rates are less than average diversification rates. Median diversification rates were 0.05–0.2 new species per million species per year. On the basis of these results, we concluded that typical rates of background extinction may be closer to 0.1 E/MSY. Thus, current extinction rates are 1,000 times higher than natural background rates of extinction and future rates are likely to be 10,000 times higher. Estimaci{\'{o}}n de la Tasa Normal de Extinci{\'{o}}n de Especies Una medida clave del impacto global de la humanidad es cu{\'{a}}nto han incrementado las tasas de extinci{\'{o}}n de las especies. Las declaraciones conocidas establecen que estas son 100 – 1,000 veces los niveles de extinci{\'{o}}n pre-humanos o de fondo. Estimar las tasas recientes es un proceso directo, pero establecer una tasa de fondo para comparar no lo es.

Exploramos l{\'{i}}neas dispares de evidencia que sugieren un estimado sustancialmente m{\'{a}}s bajo. Los datos f{\'{o}}siles producen estimados directos de las tasas de extinci{\'{o}}n, pero son temporalmente burdos, en su mayor{\'{i}}a limitados a los taxones marinos de cuerpos duros, y generalmente involucran a los g{\'{e}}neros y no a las especies. Bas{\'{a}}ndonos en estos datos, la p{\'{e}}rdida de fondo t{\'{i}}pica es de 0.01 g{\'{e}}neros por mill{\'{o}}n de g{\'{e}}neros por a{\~{n}}o. Las filogenias moleculares est{\'{a}}n disponibles para m{\'{a}}s taxones y ecosistemas, pero se debate si pueden usarse para estimar por separado las tasas de extinci{\'{o}}n y especiaci{\'{o}}n. Seleccionamos datos para dirigirnos a asuntos conocidos y los usamos para determinar los estimados de extinci{\'{o}}n medios a partir de distribuciones estad{\'{i}}sticas de valores probables para plantas y animales terrestres. Despu{\'{e}}s creamos simulaciones para explorar los efectos de las suposiciones del modelo de violaci{\'{o}}n. Finalmente, recopilamos los estimados de diversificaci{\'{o}}n – la diferencia entre las tasas de especiaci{\'{o}}n y extinci{\'{o}}n para taxones diferentes. Los estimados medios de las tasas de extinci{\'{o}}n variaron desde 0.023 hasta 0.135 E/MEA. Los resultados de la simulaci{\'{o}}n sugirieron una sobre- y subestimaci{\'{o}}n de la extinci{\'{o}}n a partir filogenias individuales que se cancelaron unas a otras cuando se analizaron conjuntos grandes de filogenias. No hubo evidencia de declinaciones generales pre-humanas, recientes y extensas en la diversidad. Esto implica que las tasas de extinci{\'{o}}n promedio son menores a las tasas de diversificaci{\'{o}}n promedio. Las tasas medias de diversificaci{\'{o}}n fueron 0.05 – 0.2 especies nuevas por mill{\'{o}}n de especies por a{\~{n}}o.

abstract = {The need for more agricultural areas stemming from population pressure has been contributing to the increased forest and grassland-to-agricultural areas conversion in recent years in the upper Mara River Basin, Kenya. The deforestation of the Mau forest and settlement on hydrological sensitive areas of the watershed along with poor soil and water conservation practices have caused the high level of soil erosion and water quality deterioration. The various efforts to curve down this problem necessitate the knowledge of the rate of erosion, surface runoff as a function of the physical and hydrometeorological characteristics of the watershed. In support of this effort, a study was conducted to evaluate the effects of three land-use/land cover practices on runoff and sediment yield using runoff plots and two models: Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) and Erosion 3D. In order to accomplish these objectives, runoff plots were established at three sites: Amala upstream; Amala downstream and Nyangores watersheds. In all of the three watersheds, three land uses (cropland, grassland and bare land) with similar slope steepness and soil types were considered. Using the data collected from the runoff plots, the WEPP and Erosion 3D models were evaluated. The plot scale research results indicated that erosion was high in all of the sites on cultivated lands. The highest total sediment yield over the study period was observed on cultivated land (162.38g/m2) in the Nyangores watershed; and the lowest sediment yield (29.95g/m2) was observed on grassland at Amala downstream site. The model evaluation indicated that both of the models perform well in estimation of runoff, however, the WEPP model performs better than Erosion 3D in estimation of soil erosion. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) often depend on landscapes surrounding them to maintain flows of organisms, water, nutrients, and energy. Park managers have little authority over the surrounding landscape although land use change and infrastructure development can have major impacts on the integrity of a PA. The need for scientifically-based regional-scale land use planning around protected areas is acute in human-dominated landscapes to balance conservation goals with livelihood needs for fuelwood, fodder, and other ecosystem services. As a first step, we propose the designation of a "zone of interaction" (ZOI) around PAs that encompasses hydrologic, ecological, and socioeconomic interactions between a PA and the surrounding landscape. We illustrate the concept by delineating the ZOI in three Indian PAs - Kanha, Ranthambore, and Nagarahole - using remote sensing, population census, and field data. The ZOI in Ranthambore is three times the size of the park and is largely defined by the socioeconomic interactions with surrounding villages. Ranthambore is located in headwaters and wildlife corridors are largely severed. In Nagarahole, the ZOI is more than seven times larger than the park and includes upstream watershed and elephant corridors. Kanha's ZOI is approximately four times larger than the park and is mostly defined by contiguous surrounding forest. The three examples highlight the differing extents of ZOIs when applying equivalent criteria, even though all are located in densely-populated landscapes. Quantitative understanding of which activities (e.g. collection of forest products, grazing, road construction, tourism development) and which locations within the ZOI are most crucial to conservation goals will enable improved land use planning around PAs in human-dominated landscapes. ??

abstract = {The processes that cause and influence movement are one of the main points of enquiry in movement ecology. However, ecology is not the only discipline interested in movement: a number of information sciences are specialising in analysis and visualisation of movement data. The recent explosion in availability and complexity of movement data has resulted in a call in ecology for new appropriate methods that would be able to take full advantage of the increasingly complex and growing data volume. One way in which this could be done is to form interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and experts from information sciences that analyse movement. In this paper we present an overview of new movement analysis and visualisation methodologies resulting from such an interdisciplinary research network: the European COST Action "MOVE - Knowledge Discovery from Moving Objects" (http://www.move-cost.info). This international network evolved over four years and brought together some 140 researchers from different disciplines: those that collect movement data (out of which the movement ecology was the largest represented group) and those that specialise in developing methods for analysis and visualisation of such data (represented in MOVE by computational geometry, geographic information science, visualisation and visual analytics). We present MOVE achievements and at the same time put them in ecological context by exploring relevant ecological themes to which MOVE studies do or potentially could contribute.},

abstract = {Although conservation intervention has reversed the decline of some species, our success is outweighed by a much larger number of species moving towards extinction. Extinction risk modelling can identify correlates of risk and species not yet recognized to be threatened. Here, we use machine learning models to identify correlates of extinction risk in African terrestrial mammals using a set of variables belonging to four classes: species distribution state, human pressures, conservation response and species biology. We derived information on distribution state and human pressure from satellite-borne imagery. Variables in all four classes were identified as important predictors of extinction risk, and interactions were observed among variables in different classes (e.g. level of protection, human threats, species distribution ranges). Species biology had a key role in mediating the effect of external variables. The model was 90{\%} accurate in classifying extinction risk status of species, but in a few cases the observed and modelled extinction risk mismatched. Species in this condition might suffer from an incorrect classification of extinction risk (hence require reassessment). An increased availability of satellite imagery combined with improved resolution and classification accuracy of the resulting maps will play a progressively greater role in conservation monitoring.},

abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the 'folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| {\textgreater}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.

abstract = {Dispersal knowledge is essential for conservation management, and demand is growing. But are we accumulating dispersal knowledge at a pace that can meet the demand? To answer this question we tested for changes in dispersal data collection and use over time. Our systematic review of 655 conservation-related publications compared five topics: climate change, habitat restoration, population viability analysis, land planning (systematic conservation planning) and invasive species. We analysed temporal changes in the: (i) questions asked by dispersal-related research; (ii) methods used to study dispersal; (iii) the quality of dispersal data; (iv) extent that dispersal knowledge is lacking, and; (v) likely consequences of limited dispersal knowledge. Research questions have changed little over time; the same problems examined in the 1990s are still being addressed. The most common methods used to study dispersal were occupancy data, expert opinion and modelling, which often provided indirect, low quality information about dispersal. Although use of genetics for estimating dispersal has increased, new ecological and genetic methods for measuring dispersal are not yet widely adopted. Almost half of the papers identified knowledge gaps related to dispersal. Limited dispersal knowledge often made it impossible to discover ecological processes or compromised conservation outcomes. The quality of dispersal data used in climate change research has increased since the 1990s. In comparison, restoration ecology inadequately addresses large-scale process, whilst the gap between knowledge accumulation and growth in applications may be increasing in land planning. To overcome apparent stagnation in collection and use of dispersal knowledge, researchers need to: (i) improve the quality of available data using new approaches; (ii) understand the complementarities of different methods and; (iii) define the value of different kinds of dispersal information for supporting management decisions. Ambitious, multi-disciplinary research programs studying many species are critical for advancing dispersal research.},

Our results unveiled a positive relationship between NDVI and elephant densities in non- forest populations, but failed to capture any significant effects of survey area and type, number of years after the continental poaching ban and the IUCN category of the protected area in which the survey was undertaken. The number of forest elephant populations for which density estimates were available was very low, and no significant relationship between NDVI and forest elephant density could be established. Altogether, our study suggests that NDVI can successfully be linked to megaherbivore abundance across Africa and further highlights that a continental approach to energyabundance relationships can be conducted in a relatively low-cost manner and short timescale, supporting managers efforts to identify future suitable areas for elephant populations},

However, there has been little attempt to develop a richer understanding of the motivations behind contemporary illegal wildlife hunting. As a first step this paper analyses academic and policy literatures and engages in key debates in the social sciences about the meanings of poverty and the relative importance of structure and individual agency. We place motivations for illegal wildlife hunting within the context of the complex history of how wildlife laws were initially designed and enforced. We also consider the nature of poverty and the reasons for economic deprivation in particular communities.

abstract = {Africa is on the verge of a mining boom. We review the environmental threats from African mining development, including habitat alteration, infrastructure expansion, human migration, bushmeat hunting, corruption, and weak governance. We illustrate these threats in Central Africa, which contains the vast Congo rainforest, and show that more than a quarter of 4,151 recorded mineral occurrences are concentrated in three regions of biological endemism—the Cameroon-Gabon Lowlands, Eastern DRC Lowlands, and Albertine Rift Mountains—and that most of these sites are currently unprotected. Threats are not uniform spatially, and much of the Congo Basin is devoid of mineral occurrences and may be spared from direct mining impacts. Some of the environmental impacts of African mining development could potentially be offset: mining set-asides could protect some wildlife habitats, whereas improving transportation networks could increase crop yields and spare land for conservation. Research and policy measures are needed to (1) understand the synergies between mining and other development activities, (2) improve environmental impact assessments, (3) devise mitigation and offsetting mechanisms, and (4) identify market choke points where lobbying can improve environmental practice. Without careful management, rapid mining expansion and its associated secondary effects will have severe impacts on African environments and biodiversity.},

The Phragmites mauritianus community occurs largely in the Panhandle where channel margins have high clay contents and where soils are seasonally flooded for moderate periods (months). Fires are widespread in the Panhandle, but both Pennisetum glaucocladum and Phragmites mauritianus are stoloniferous, and meristems occur below the soil surface and are protected from fire. In contrast, the rhizomatous sedge C papyrus dominates in situations where meristems are permanently submerged, and therefore protected from fire, such as areas of open channel water where current velocities are sufficiently low to enable the extension of C. papyrus into the channel. This situation exists where channel avulsion has recently taken place or where discharge is reduced by water loss from the channel by overspill. The semi-floating habit of C. papyrus in the channel fringe results in high hydraulic conductivities, which promotes water loss from channels and leads to sediment deposition within channels. Miscanthus junceus occurs in areas where the nutrient status of water is low, seasonal changes in water level are small,. and the average water level is approximately constant over decadal time scales. It occurs some distance from the-channel on the upper reaches of the Delta and progressively closer to the channel downstream such that. it is the dominant channel fringe species in the distal reaches.. This pattern, where a community occurs progressively closer-to the channel downstream is similar for communities dominated by Imperata cylindrica and Pycreus nitidus suggesting that environmental gradients (probably nutrient supply) perpendicular to-the channel axis are steep and that they am mirrored by long-range environmental gradients downstream. An analysis of hydraulic characteristics of this distributary river system illustrates that channel width varies most with variation in discharge, while channel depth and current velocity are relatively constant over the range of discharges in the study area. Since channel width, is primarily a consequence of vegetation processes in the channel margin, especially the growth of the giant sedge C papyrus it is clear that channel hydraulics are affected largely by vegetation.},

abstract = {AimUnderstanding the factors that govern species' geographical ranges is of utmost importance for predicting potential range shifts triggered by environmental change. Species ranges are partially limited by their tolerances to extrinsic environmental conditions such as climate and habitat. However, they are also determined by the capacity of species to disperse, establish new populations and proliferate, which are in turn dependent on species intrinsic life-history traits. So far, the contribution of intrinsic factors driving species distributions has been inconclusive, largely because intrinsic and extrinsic factors have not been examined simultaneously in a satisfactory way. We investigate how geographical ranges of plants are determined by both extrinsic environmental factors and species intrinsic life-history traits.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nLocationEurope.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMethodsWe compiled a database on plant geographical ranges, environmental tolerances and life-history traits that constitutes the largest dataset analysed to date (1276 species). We used generalized linear modelling to test if range size and range filling (the proportion of climatically suitable area a species occupies) are affected by dispersal distance, habitat breadth and 10 life-history traits related to establishment and proliferation.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nResultsThe species characteristics that were most linked to range limitations of European plant species were dispersal potential, seed bank persistence and habitat breadth (which together explained 30{\%} of deviance in range filling and range size). Specific leaf area, which has been linked to establishment ability, made a smaller contribution to native range limitations.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMain conclusionsOur results can be used to improve estimates of extinction vulnerability under climate change. Species with high dispersal capacity, that can maintain viable seed banks for several years and that can live in an intermediate number of habitats have the fewest non-climatic limitations on their ranges, and are most likely to shift their geographical ranges under climate change. We suggest that climate-change risk assessments should not focus exclusively on dispersal capacity.},

Human-elephant conflict (HEC), in particular crop-raiding, is a significant and complex conservation problem wherever elephants and people occupy the same space. Conservationists and wildlife managers build electrified fences as a technical solution to this problem. Fences provide a spatial means of controlling human-elephant interactions by creating a place for elephants and a place for cultivation. They are often planned and designed based on the ecology of the target species. Yet as we show in this case study, behind their technical fa??ade, fences are highly political. This article presents the process of planning and building the 121. km West Laikipia Fence: created to prevent elephants from moving out of large private and government-owned ranches and onto smallholder cultivated land to the west of Laikipia County. We seek to show how the construction of a fence to solve the problem of HEC led to the division, reinforcement and communication of territory on the ground and how this was captured and shaped by different, and sometimes conflicting, political interests.},

abstract = {n Abstract The literature on effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity is huge. It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in dif- ferent ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually deﬁned as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habi- tat. Results of empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difﬁcult to inter- pret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat frag- mentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the inﬂuence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se. I suggest that the term “fragmen- tation” should be reserved for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss.},

abstract = {I synthesize the understanding of the relationship between landscape structure and animal movement in human-modified landscapes. 2. The variety of landscape structures is first classified into four categories: continuous habitat, patchy habitat with high-quality matrix, patchy habitat with low-quality matrix, and patchy, ephemeral habitat. Using this simplification I group the range of evolved movement parameters into four categories or movement types. I then discuss how these movement types interact with current human-caused landscape changes, and how this often results in non-optimal movement. 3. From this synthesis I develop a hypothesis that predicts the relative importance of the different population-level consequences of these non-optimal movements, for the four movement types. 4. Populations of species that have inhabited landscapes with high habitat cover or patchy landscapes with low-risk matrix should have evolved low boundary responses and moderate to high movement probabilities. These species are predicted to be highly susceptible to increased movement mortality resulting from habitat loss and reduced matrix quality. 5. In contrast, populations of species that evolved in patchy landscapes with high-risk matrix or dynamic patchy landscapes are predicted to be highly susceptible to decreased immigration and colonization success, due to the increasing patch isolation that results from habitat loss. 6. Finally, I discuss three implications of this synthesis: (i) ‘least cost path' analysis should not be used for land management decisions without data on actual movement paths and movement risks in the landscape; (ii) ‘dispersal ability' is not simply an attribute of a species, but varies strongly with landscape structure such that the relative rankings of species' dispersal abilities can change following landscape alteration; and (iii) the assumption that more mobile species are more resilient to human-caused landscape change is not generally true, but depends on the structure of the landscape where the species evolved.},

abstract = {How animals change their movement patterns in relation to the environment is a central topic in a wide area of ecology, including foraging ecology, habitat selection, and spatial population ecology. To understand the underlying behavioral mechanisms involved, there is a need for methods to measure changes in movement patterns along a pathway through the landscape. We used simulated pathways and satellite tracking of a long-ranging seabird to explore the properties of first-passage time as a measure of search effort along a path. The first-passage time is defined as the time required for an animal to cross a circle with a given radius. It is a measure of how much time an animal uses within a given area. First-passage time is scale dependent, and a plot of variance in first-passage time vs. spatial scale reveals the spatial scale at which the animal concentrates its search effort. By averaging the first-passage time on a geographical grid, it is possible to relate first-passage time to environmental variables and the search pattern of other individuals.

abstract = {Classifying surface cover types and analyzing changes are among the most common applications of remote sensing. One of the most basic classification tasks is to distinguish water bodies from dry land surfaces. Landsat imagery is among the most widely used sources of data in remote sensing of water resources; and although several techniques of surface water extraction using Landsat data are described in the literature, their application is constrained by low accuracy in various situations. Besides, with the use of techniques such as single band thresholding and two-band indices, identifying an appropriate threshold yielding the highest possible accuracy is a challenging and time consuming task, as threshold values vary with location and time of image acquisition. The purpose of this study was therefore to devise an index that consistently improves water extraction accuracy in the presence of various sorts of environmental noise and at the same time offers a stable threshold value. Thus we introduced a new Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) improving classification accuracy in areas that include shadow and dark surfaces that other classification methods often fail to classify correctly. We tested the accuracy and robustness of the new method using Landsat 5 TM images of several water bodies in Denmark, Switzerland, Ethiopia, South Africa and New Zealand. Kappa coefficient, omission and commission errors were calculated to evaluate accuracies. The performance of the classifier was compared with that of the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) classifiers. In four out of five test sites, classification accuracy of AWEI was significantly higher than that of MNDWI and ML (P-value{\textless}. 0.01). AWEI improved accuracy by lessening commission and omission errors by 50{\%} compared to those resulting from MNDWI and about 25{\%} compared to ML classifiers. Besides, the new method was shown to have a fairly stable optimal threshold value. Therefore, AWEI can be used for extracting water with high accuracy, especially in mountainous areas where deep shadow caused by the terrain is an important source of classification error. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Much of our present knowledge of mixed migration strategies of northern populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) comes from short-term studies, which limits the observed variation of winter severity and thus our understanding of its potential influence on the migration behavior of study cohorts. From 1991 to 2006, we assessed the incidence of autumn migratory versus nonmigratory behavior of 335 adult ({\textgreater}1.0 year old) females, what proportion were conditional versus obligate migrators, the importance of winter severity as a factor affecting the migratory response, and the effect of winter severity and study length on the classification of deer as conditional or obligate migrators and composition of study populations. Annual winter conditions ranged from historically mild to severe. The annual estimated proportion of deer migrating from spring -summer-autumn range to winter range was positively related to winter severity, and the cumulative probability of deer migrating tracked accumulating snow depths as winters progressed. However, the relationship was highly variable, largely attributable to the annual variation in migratory behavior of individuals radiomonitored for 2 years. Importantly, because of the variability of autumn winter weather conditions, we noted that the proportion of deer we classified as obligate migrators was inversely related to the number of years individuals were monitored. Further, the composition (nonmigratory, conditional, and obligate migrators) of the study cohort was strongly influenced by the severity of winter conditions in the year of capture, as well as in subsequent winters of monitoring.},

abstract = {Landscape modification and habitat fragmentation are key drivers of global species loss. Their effects may be understood by focusing on: (1) individual species and the processes threatening them, and (2) human-perceived landscape patterns and their correlation with species and assemblages. Individual species may decline as a result of interacting exogenous and endogenous threats, including habitat loss, habitat degradation, habitat isolation, changes in the biology, behaviour, and interactions of species, as well as additional, stochastic threats. Human-perceived landscape patterns that are frequently correlated with species assemblages include the amount and structure of native vegetation, the prevalence of anthropogenic edges, the degree of landscape connectivity, and the structure and heterogeneity of modified areas. Extinction cascades are particularly likely to occur in landscapes with low native vegetation cover, low landscape connectivity, degraded native vegetation and intensive land use in modified areas, especially if keystone species or entire functional groups of species are lost. This review (1) demonstrates that species-oriented and pattern- oriented approaches to understanding the ecology of modified landscapes are highly complementary, (2) clarifies the links between a wide range of interconnected themes, and (3) provides clear and consistent terminology. Tangible research and management priorities are outlined that are likely to benefit the conservation of native species in modified landscapes around the world},

abstract = {Animal groups arise from individuals' choices about the number, characteristics, and identity of associates. Individuals make these choices to gain benefits from their associations. As the needs of an individual change with its phenotype, so too we expect the nature of its associations to vary. In this paper, we investigate how the social priorities of male plains zebra ( Equus burchelli ) depend on reproductive state. An adult male is either a bachelor, and lacking mating access, or a stallion defending a harem. Multiple harems and bachelor males aggregate in larger herds. Herds frequently split and merge, affording males opportunities to change associates. Over a 4-year period, we sampled the herd associations in a population of 500–700 zebras. To isolate the effects of reproductive state on male social behavior, we account for potential confounding factors: changes in population size, grouping tendencies, and sampling intensity. We develop a generally applicable permutation procedure, which allows us to test the null hypothesis that social behavior is independent of male status. Averaging over all individuals in the population, we find that a typical bachelor is found in herds containing significantly more adults, bachelors, and stallions than the herds of a typical stallion. Further, bachelors' bonds with each other are more persistent over time than those among stallions. These results suggest that bachelors form cohesive cliques, in which we may expect cooperative behaviors to develop. Stallion–stallion associations are more diffuse, and less conducive to long-term cooperation.},

abstract = {In animal groups, collective movements emerge from individual interactions. Biologists seek to identify how characteristics of actors in these groups, and their relationships, influence the decision-making process. We distinguished two basic factors determining leadership in group choices: identity and state. We hypothesized that identity is more important to leadership in groups with stable relationships, which permit the development of habitual roles. In groups with fluid membership, particular individuals or subgroups are less likely to emerge as consistent leaders. Instead, we predicted that movement initiation in unstable groups depends on individual state at the time of the decision. We characterized how identity and reproductive state influenced leadership patterns in the movements of plains zebra. As in many other mammals, lactation in this species significantly alters water and energy needs. We investigated leadership in tightly knit harems and loosely bonded herds of multiple harems. Harem females tended to have habitual roles in the initiation of harem movement. In herds, however, we found no consistent leaders among harems. At both levels of social organization, lactation was a key determinant of leadership. In harems, lactating females were more likely to initiate movement than nonlactating females. In turn, harems containing lactating females were more likely to lead herd movements. Thus, we conclude that social relationships and reproductive state together shape the interactions that produce group behaviours. One benefit to lactating females of leading herd movements is preferential access to scarce water. Thus, leadership roles in group decisions may have fitness consequences. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

As a key prey item for lions (Panthera leo), plains zebras (Equus burchelli) were expected to respond to immediate threats posed by lions in their area. In addition, zebras were predicted to exhibit behavior tuned to reduce the potential for encounters with lions, by modifying their movement patterns in the times of day and habitats of greatest lion danger. We studied a population of approximately 600 plains zebra living in Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Kenya. We found that zebra abundance on or near a grassland patch was lower if lions had also been observed on that patch during the same day. Predation danger was highest in grassland habitat during the night, when lions were more active. Zebra sightings and global positioning system radio collar data indicated that zebras also reduced their use of grassland at night, instead using more woodland habitat. Zebrasmoved faster and took sharper turns in grassland at night. It is hypothesized that these more erratic movements assist zebras in avoiding detection or capture by lions.

abstract = {Automating the accurate classification of water in Landsat imagery will benefit many researchers conducting large-area multi-temporal analyses of the USGS archive. We propose that water index methods based on data normalised to surface reflectance, using thresholds optimised for a large selection of data, provide a simple yet accurate method for automated water classification across large regions. In order to select the best index for this task a comprehensive comparative analyses was required. We assessed the accuracy of seven water index methods for classifying water in 30m resolution Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI imagery from eastern Australia. These indexes were the Automated Water Extraction Index for images with shadows (AWEIshadow) and without shadows (AWEIno shadow), tasselled cap wetness (TCWCrist), two variations of the normalised difference water index (NDWIMcFeeters and NDWIXu), a water index created using canonical variates analysis from top-of-atmosphere data (WI2006), and a new water index created with linear discriminant analysis from data processed to surface reflectance (WI2015). A wide variety of water (50,868), non-water (36,833) and mixed (16,499) validation pixels were selected from Landsat images across the states of New South Wales and Queensland. Water area and the colour of water and non-water features were determined for each validation pixel using coincident high resolution imagery and TM/ETM+ reflectance. A single optimum threshold for classifying each index into water and non-water was determined using pure pixels. In general the WI2015, WI2006 and AWEIshadow performed the best, with all indexes achieving overall accuracies of 95-99{\%} for pure pixels, and 73-75{\%} for mixed pixels. Omission errors were more common than commission errors, and water area was usually underestimated, especially where water was green-brown in colour, and/or where water bodies were small or had long perimeters with many mixed pixels. The accuracy of each index was highly dependent on the composition of the validation pixels, with no index performing best across all water and non-water pixel types. All indexes and thresholds were found to perform consistently across images from the TM, ETM+ and OLI sensors, facilitating the automated classification of water to similar levels of accuracy for the growing archive of Landsat data.},

abstract = {Quantifying animals' home ranges is a key problem in ecology and has important conservation and wildlife management applications. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a workhorse technique for range delineation problems that is both statistically efficient and nonparametric. KDE assumes that the data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, animal tracking data, which are routinely used as inputs to KDEs, are inherently autocorrelated and violate this key assumption. As we demonstrate, using realistically autocorrelated data in conventional KDEs results in grossly underestimated home ranges. We further show that the performance of conventional KDEs actually degrades as data quality improves, because autocorrelation strength increases as movement paths become more finely resolved. To remedy these flaws with the traditional KDE method, we derive an autocorrelated KDE (AKDE) from first principles to use autocorrelated data, making it perfectly suited for movement data sets. We illustrate the vastly improved performance of AKDE using analytical arguments, relocation data from Mongolian gazelles, and simulations based upon the gazelle's observed movement process. By yielding better minimum area estimates for threatened wildlife populations, we believe that future widespread use of AKDE will have significant impact on ecology and conservation biology.},

Today, approximately a billion people are chronically malnourished while our agricultural systems are concurrently degrading land, water, biodiversity and climate on a global scale. To meet the world's future food security and sustainability needs, food production must grow substantially while, at the same time, agriculture's environmental footprint must shrink dramatically. Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma, showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion, closing 'yield gaps' on underperforming lands, increasing cropping efficiency, shifting diets and reducing waste. Together, these strategies could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.},

Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases.

abstract = {Patterns of resource selection by animal populations emerge as a result of the behavior of many individuals. Statistical models that describe these population-level patterns of habitat use can miss important interactions between individual animals and characteristics of their local environment; however, identifying these interactions is difficult. One approach to this problem is to incorporate models of individual movement into resource selection models. To do this, we propose a model for step selection functions (SSF) that is composed of a resource-independent movement kernel and a resource selection function (RSF). We show that standard case-control logistic regression may be used to fit the SSF; however, the sampling scheme used to generate control points (i.e., the definition of availability) must be accommodated. We used three sampling schemes to analyze simulated movement data and found that ignoring sampling and the resource-independent movement kernel yielded biased estimates of selection. The level of bias depended on the method used to generate control locations, the strength of selection, and the spatial scale of the resource map. Using empirical or parametric methods to sample control locations produced biased estimates under stronger selection; however, we show that the addition of a distance function to the analysis substantially reduced that bias. Assuming a uniform availability within a fixed buffer yielded strongly biased selection estimates that could be corrected by including the distance function but remained inefficient relative to the empirical and parametric sampling methods. As a case study, we used location data collected from elk in Yellowstone National Park, USA, to show that selection and bias may be temporally variable. Because under constant selection the amount of bias depends on the scale at which a resource is distributed in the landscape, we suggest that distance always be included as a covariate in SSF analyses. This approach to modeling resource selection is easily implemented using common statistical tools and promises to provide deeper insight into the movement ecology of animals.},

abstract = {Until recently, advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) observations were the only viable source of data for global land cover mapping. While many useful insights have been gained from analyses based on AVHRR data, the availability of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with greatly improved spectral, spatial, geometric, and radiometric attributes provides significant new opportunities and challenges for remote sensing-based land cover mapping research. In this paper, we describe the algorithms and databases being used to produce the MODIS global land cover product. This product provides maps of global land cover at 1-km spatial resolution using several classification systems, principally that of the IGBP. To generate these maps, a supervised classification methodology is used that exploits a global database of training sites interpreted from high-resolution imagery in association with ancillary data. In addition to the IGBP class at each pixel, the MODIS land cover product provides several other parameters including estimates for the classification confidence associated with the IGBP label, a prediction for the most likely alternative class, and class labels for several other classification schemes that are used by the global modeling community. Initial results based on 5 months of MODIS data are encouraging. At global scales, the distribution of vegetation and land cover types is qualitatively realistic. At regional scales, comparisons among heritage AVHRR products, Landsat TM data, and results from MODIS show that the algorithm is performing well. As a longer time series of data is added to the processing stream and the representation of global land cover in the site database is refined, the quality of the MODIS land cover product will improve accordingly.

abstract = {Information related to land cover is immensely important to global change science. In the past decade, data sources and methodologies for creating global land cover maps from remote sensing have evolved rapidly. Here we describe the datasets and algorithms used to create the Collection 5 MODIS Global Land Cover Type product, which is substantially changed relative to Collection 4. In addition to using updated input data, the algorithm and ancillary datasets used to produce the product have been refined. Most importantly, the Collection 5 product is generated at 500-m spatial resolution, providing a four-fold increase in spatial resolution relative to the previous version. In addition, many components of the classification algorithm have been changed. The training site database has been revised, land surface temperature is now included as an input feature, and ancillary datasets used in post-processing of ensemble decision tree results have been updated. Further, methods used to correct classifier results for bias imposed by training data properties have been refined, techniques used to fuse ancillary data based on spatially varying prior probabilities have been revised, and a variety of methods have been developed to address limitations of the algorithm for the urban, wetland, and deciduous needleleaf classes. Finally, techniques used to stabilize classification results across years have been developed and implemented to reduce year-to-year variation in land cover labels not associated with land cover change. Results from a cross-validation analysis indicate that the overall accuracy of the product is about 75{\%} correctly classified, but that the range in class-specific accuracies is large. Comparison of Collection 5 maps with Collection 4 results show substantial differences arising from increased spatial resolution and changes in the input data and classification algorithm. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Many populations of large herbivores migrate seasonally between discrete home ranges. Current evidence suggests that migration is generally selected for as a means of enhancing access to high quality food and/or reducing the risk of predation. The relative importance of these alternative selection pressures should depend on the demographic circumstances facing a given population. Seasonal migration also has important implications for the structure and dynamics of large herbivore communities. Migrants should tend to be regulated by food availability, while residents should tend to be regulated by predators As a result, migrants should often outnumber residents by a considerable margin - a pattern seen in several tropical and temperate ecosystems. Differences in the mode of regulation could also imply that competition for resources will be weak in purely resident assemblages, but strong in communities dominated by migrants. Continual grazing by resident herbivores can sometimes lead to degeneration of vegetation, while systems supporting migrants are apparently more resilient. This implies that migration can have an important impact on the long-term persistence of plant-herbivore systems, particularly in areas with slow rates of vegetation regeneration. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {Recent theory suggests that animals should switch facultatively among canonical movement modes as a complex function of internal state, landscape characteristics, motion capacity, and navigational capacity. We tested the generality of this paradigm for free-ranging elk (Cervus elaphus) over 5 orders of magnitude in time (minutes to years) and space (meters to 100 km). At the coarsest spatiotemporal scale, elk shifted from a dispersive to a home-ranging phase over the course of 1-3 years after introduction into a novel environment. At intermediate spatiotemporal scales, elk continued to alternate between movement modes. During the dispersive phase, elk alternated between encamped and exploratory modes, possibly linked to changes in motivational goals from foraging to social bonding. During the home-ranging phase, elk movements were characterized by a complex interplay between attraction to preferred habitat types and memory of previous movements across the home-range. At the finest temporal and spatial scale, elk used area-restricted search while browsing, interspersed with less sinuous paths when not browsing. Encountering a patch of high-quality food plants triggered the switch from one mode to the next, creating biphasic movement dynamics that were reinforced by local resource heterogeneity. These patterns suggest that multiphasic structure is fundamental to the movement patterns of elk at all temporal and spatial scales tested.},

abstract = {Species persistence can be threatened by substantial temporal variation in food resources over time. On the other hand, spatial heterogeneity in resources at the landscape scale might allow mobile consumers to compensate for temporal variability in resource availability at the local scale. We evaluated this hypothesis, using an extensive data set on foraging, grass growth, and movement by Thomson's gazelles living on the Serengeti Plains. Here we show that modelled populations of Thomson's gazelles can only persist under Serengeti conditions in the face of observed levels of rainfall stochasticity by making adaptive movements to take advantage of ephemeral spatial distributions of food resources. More importantly, our models suggest that Thomson's gazelles in Serengeti require unrestricted access to relatively large areas of grassland ({\textgreater} 1600 km(2)) to guarantee long-term persistence, particularly when there is positive spatial autocorrelation in resource abundance, as is the case in Serengeti. If this proves to be true for other species and/or other systems, then understanding of complex behavioural responses to spatially and temporally heterogeneous food supplies may be essential to successful conservation of grazing herbivores.},

abstract = {Conflict between wildlife and people can erode local support for conservation. Wildlife-based benefits are intended to offset costs and encourage tolerance or stewardship, but where the linkage between benefits and wildlife is not understood, benefits may be ineffective at bolstering conservation. In Laikipia, Kenya, wildlife and areas devoted to wildlife are on the increase, but most residents still suffer losses to wildlife and derive minimal benefits. The elephant situation is particularly problematic because elephants may compete with livestock for resources, raid people's crops, and chase and kill livestock and people. Although most unprotected elephant range in East Africa is in semi-arid rangelands occupied by pastoralists, previous research has emphasized agricultural, not pastoral or agri-pastoral conflicts. Between 1999 and 2002, interviews were conducted in Laikipia District to examine whether pastoralists also experience conflict, and to determine whether wildlife conservation provided appreciable benefits to residents, or fostered pro-conservation attitudes among residents. Three properties, Endana, Koija and Mpala, were selected to include the two primary land uses in Laikipia (livestock and agriculture) and two levels of wildlife-based benefits (indirect benefits and direct benefits from a locally-owned tourism operation). People were negative about many aspects of local wildlife conservation, especially animals that raided crops or were dangerous. Fundamental differences in attitudes were attributable to primary land use; within ethnic groups, people practising agriculture were less tolerant of elephants than people practising pastoralism. Despite evidence that elephants may compete with livestock for forage, ecological competition was not a primary concern among cattle-keeping people. In communities that received indirect benefits from tourism or wildlife, the connection between wildlife and employment or aid in kind was usually overlooked. Unlike elsewhere in Africa, education and wealth did not correlate with positive attitudes towards wildlife because the tourism programme was improving the situation and the outlook of people lacking education and material wealth. Pastoral people with indirect financial benefits expressed positive attitudes towards elephants for aesthetic reasons, while pastoral people with direct benefits cited financial rewards derived from tourism but attributed aesthetic values to living with elephants. The programme in the pastoral community receiving benefits was exemplary in that benefits were tangible, and the participants appreciated the linkage between benefits and active conservation. Land conversion from pastoralism to agriculture threatens elephant survival, not only in terms of habitat loss, but also in terms of lost tolerance among people who have shifted to farming.},

abstract = {The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 $\mu$m and a near-IR channel around 0.86 $\mu$m. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as (p(0.86 $\mu$m) - $\rho$(1.24 $\mu$m))/($\rho$(0.86 $\mu$m) + $\rho$(1.24 $\mu$m)), where $\rho$ represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-$\mu$m and the 1.24-$\mu$m channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 $\mu$m is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 $\mu$m is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86-1.24 $\mu$m region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24-$\mu$m channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 $\mu$m. NDWI should be considered as an independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Jasper Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI. Comparisons between NDWI and NDVI images are also given.},

abstract = {1. A large proportion of the world's biodiversity is reportedly threatened by habitat loss and climate change. However, there are few studies that investigate the interaction between these two threats using empirical data. 2. Here, we investigate interactions between climate change and land-use change in the future distribution of 23 dominant tree species in mainland Spain. We simulated changes up to year 2100 using a climate-dependent Stochastic Patch Occupancy Model, parameterized with colo- nization and extinction events recorded in 46 596 survey plots. 3. We estimated that the distribution of 17 out of 23 tree species are expanding and hence not at equilibrium with the climate. However, climate change will make the future occupancy of 15 species to be lower than expected if climate, and habitat, remained stable (baseline scenario). 4. Climate change, when combined with the loss of 20{\%} of the habitat, was estimated to reduce species occupancies (relative to baseline projections) by an average of 23{\%} if habitat loss was spatially clumped, and by 35{\%} if it was scattered. If habitat loss occurred in areas already impacted by human activities, species occupancies would be reduced by 26{\%}. Land- use changes leading to habitat gain (i.e. creation through reforestation) could slightly mitigate the effects of climate change, but a 20{\%} increment in habitat would reduce climate change- driven losses in species occupancies by only 3{\%}. 5. Synthesis and applications. The distributions of the most common tree species in mainland Spain are expanding, but climate change threatens to reduce this expansion by 18{\%} for 15 of the 23 studied species. Moreover, if the habitat of these species is simultaneously lost, the occupancies of all of them will be reduced further, with variation depending on the spatial pattern of the lost habitats. However, we did not detect synergies between climate change and habitat loss. The combined effect (with 20{\%} habitat loss) was 5–13{\%} less than what it would be if the effects were additive. Importantly, reforestation could partially offset the negative effects of climate change, but complete mitigation would require an increase in forested land of 80{\%}, and the prioritization of territories that are less impacted by human activities.},

abstract = {Despite wide agreement that strictly protected areas (World Conservation Union categories I-III) are the best strategy for conserving biodiversity, they are limited in extent and exclude many species of key conservation importance. In contrast, multiple-use management areas (categories IV-VI), comprising {\textgreater}60{\%} of the world's protected-area network, are often considered of little value to biodiversity conservation, particularly in Africa, where they typically contain few charismatic large mammals. We sampled small mammals, amphibians, birds, butterflies, and trees at 41 sites along a four-step gradient of increasing human activity and decreasing conservation protection, from a well-protected Tanzanian national park to nonintensive agricultural land. Although preliminary, our results indicate that species richness of these five taxa did not decline along this gradient, but different management areas, occupying areas of largely similar habitat, hosted distinct communities of each taxon. Differences in species composition in the absence of manifest differences in species richness highlight the importance of developing landscape-scale conservation strategies and the danger of using either a limited suite of indicator taxa or umbrella species as surrogates for biodiversity. Although strictly protected areas perform a unique and vital conservation service in East Africa by protecting large mammals, areas that allow varied resource extraction activities still possess vital and complementary conservation value.},

abstract = {* 1Where wildlife is not formally protected in Africa, abundant species are often consumptively managed, for benefit, control, or both. Such management should preferably be based on some understanding of the ecological processes regulating populations, the extent to which wildlife conflicts with livestock, and the rates at which wildlife can be harvested on a sustainable basis.$\backslash$n* 2We report the results of a simulation modelling analysis of the dynamics of a plains zebra population in Laikipia District, Kenya. This largely unfenced, non-protected area of 9666 km2 is comprised of privately, publicly, and communally owned properties supporting livestock and wildlife. We examined the influence of rainfall on zebra abundance, and evaluated the sustainability of alternative harvesting regimes.$\backslash$n* 3The model was stage- and sex-structured, corresponding with age/sex classes recognizable in the field. Vital rates and age at first reproduction were adjusted annually using two alternative approaches, both involving annual re-calculation of carrying capacity as a function of rainfall. The first adjustment factor was simply a function of carrying capacity – a solely ‘Rainfall-Dependent' (RD) mechanism. The second adjustment factor was proportional to the ratio of carrying capacity to population size – a Rainfall-Mediated Density-Dependent (RMDD) mechanism.$\backslash$n* 4Both versions of the model reconstructed known zebra dynamics over the last 16 years within the precision afforded by sample counting. However, RMDD gave a better fit, yielded parameter settings that were meaningful ecologically, and better predicted the impact of a severe drought than did RD. We infer that rainfall strongly influences the abundance of Laikipia's zebras by a mechanism involving adjustments in the strength of density dependence.$\backslash$n* 5Simulations using RMDD suggested that previously allocated annual harvest quotas in Laikipia (up to 15{\%}) might not have been sustainable, but a 6{\%} annual harvest would be a sustainable harvest.$\backslash$n* 6Synthesis and applications: The model captures a fundamental feature of the mechanism by which rainfall limits large-bodied savanna ungulates: populations typically decline faster during dry phases than they can increase during wet phases. As a result, the greater the variation in annual rainfall, the greater the proportion of time the population spends below carrying capacity. The model has been adopted as the basis for zebra management in Laikipia. To our knowledge, this is the first population-specific model to be used to guide the consumptive management of a wild ungulate in Kenya.},

abstract = {Long distance migrations by ungulate species often surpass the boundaries of preservation areas where conflicts with various publics lead to management actions that can threaten populations. We chose the partially migratory bison (Bison bison) population in Yellowstone National Park as an example of integrating science into management policies to better conserve migratory ungulates. Approximately 60{\%} of these bison have been exposed to bovine brucellosis and thousands of migrants exiting the park boundary have been culled during the past two decades to reduce the risk of disease transmission to cattle. Data were assimilated using models representing competing hypotheses of bison migration during 1990-2009 in a hierarchal bayesian framework. Migration differed at the scale of herds, but a single unifying logistic model was useful for predicting migrations by both herds. Migration beyond the northern park boundary was affected by herd size, accumulated snow water equivalent, and aboveground dried biomass. Migration beyond the western park boundary was less influenced by these predictors and process model performance suggested an important control on recent migrations was excluded. Simulations of migrations over the next decade suggest that allowing increased numbers of bison beyond park boundaries during severe climate conditions may be the only means of avoiding episodic, large-scale reductions to the Yellowstone bison population in the foreseeable future. This research is an example of how long distance migration dynamics can be incorporated into improved management policies.},

abstract = {Surveys of water quality in the surface waters in the Serengeti National Park were undertaken in both the wet and dry seasons of 1996, Most rivers were ponded, with ponds having a flushing time of 1 month in the wet season and zero flushing in the dry season. pH values varied spatially from extremely alkaline conditions (pH{\textgreater}10) in the southern plains to acidic conditions in the northern region (pH = 5.9). In the southern plains at the end of the dry season the salinity of surface waters was high (5-17 parts per thousand) while there was abundant surface water and the zebras and wildebeest had started to migrate away, a finding suggesting excessive salinity may be the trigger initiating the annual migration. Most surface waters were heavily eutrophicated as a result of animal dung. hs a result, the dissolved oxygen concentration near the surface fluctuated widely between 1 and 200{\%} of saturation, smaller values occurring deeper in the water column. Stirring and mechanical aeration by hippos, crocodiles and mammals crossing the rivers prevented the formation of anoxic conditions. The oxygen stress was measurably lessened in wetland-fringed water bodies as a result of filtering. Light penetration was high (greater than or equal to 10 cm) in saline waters as a result of flocculation enhanced by bacteria and vegetation detritus, elsewhere the euphotic zone was less than 1 cm thick and the waters generally inhospitable to aquatic life. The discontinuity between wooded savanna and grassland coincides with the occurrence of alkaline, high salinity waters in the dry season.},

abstract = {Using corridors for conservation is increasing despite a lack of consensus on their efficacy. Specifically, whether corridors increase movement of plants and animals between habitat fragments has been addressed on a case-by-case basis with mixed results. Because of the growing number of well-designed experiments that have addressed this question, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether corridors increase movement; whether corridor effectiveness differs among taxa; how recent changes in experimental design have influenced findings; and whether corridor effectiveness differs between manipulative and natural experiments. To conduct our meta-analysis, we analyzed 78 experiments from 35 studies using a conservative hierarchical Bayesian model that accounts for hierarchical and sampling dependence. We found a highly significant result that corridors increase movement between habitat patches by approximately 50{\%} compared to patches that are not connected with corridors. We found that corridors were more important for the movement of invertebrates, nonavian vertebrates, and plants than they were for birds. Recent methodological advances in corridor experiments, such as controlling for the area added by corridors, did not influence whether corridors increased movement, whereas controlling for the distance between source and connected or unconnected recipient patches decreased movement through corridors. After controlling for taxa differences and whether studies controlled for distance in experimental design, we found that natural corridors (those existing in landscapes prior to the study) showed more movement than manipulated corridors (those created and maintained for the study). Our results suggest that existing corridors increase species movement in fragmented landscapes and that efforts spent on maintaining and creating corridors are worthwhile.

In recent years, substantial advancement has been achieved in generating such data products. Yet, we are far from producing geospatially consistent high-quality data at an operational level. We compared the recently available Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC-2000) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) global land cover data to evaluate the similarities and differences in methodologies and results, and to identify areas of spatial agreement and disagreement. These two global land cover data sets were prepared using different data sources, classification systems, and methodologies, but using the same spatial resolution (i.e., 1 km) satellite data. Our analysis shows a general agreement at the class aggregate level except for savannas/shrublands, and wetlands. The disagreement, however, increases when comparing detailed land cover classes. Similarly, percent agreement between the two data sets was found to be highly variable among biomes. The identified areas of spatial agreement and disagreement will be useful for both data producers and users. Data producers may use the areas of spatial agreement for training area selection and pay special attention to areas of disagreement for further improvement in future land cover characterization and mapping. Users can conveniently use the findings in the areas of agreement, whereas users might need to verify the informaiton in the areas of disagreement with the help of secondary information. Learning from past experience and building on the existing infrastructure (e.g., regional networks), further research is necessary to (1) reduce ambiguity in land cover definitions, (2) increase availability of improved spatial, spectral, radiometric, and geometric resolution satellite data, and (3) develop advanced classification algorithms. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {1. Savanna ecosystems are defined largely by tree-grass mixtures, and tree establishment is a key driver of community structure and ecosystem function in these systems. The factors controlling savanna tree establishment are understudied, but likely involve some combination of seed, microsite and predator/fire limitation. In African savannas, suppression and killing of adult trees by large mammals like elephants (Loxodonta africana Blumenbach, 1797) and giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis Linnaeus, 1758) can maintain tree-grass co-dominance, although the impacts of even these conspicuous herbivores on tree establishment also are poorly understood. 2. We combined seed addition and predator exclusion experiments with a large-scale, long-term field manipulation of large herbivores to investigate the relative importance of seeds, microsites and predators in limiting establishment of a monodominant tree (Acacia drepanolobium Sjostedt) in a Kenyan savanna. 3. Both wild and domestic (i.e. cattle; Bos taurus Linnaeus, 1758) large herbivores facilitated tree establishment by suppressing abundances of rodents, the most important seed and seedling predators. However, this indirect, positive effect of wild herbivores was negated by wild herbivores' suppression of seed production. Cattle did not have this direct, negative impact; rather, they further assisted tree establishment by reducing cover of understorey grasses. Thus, the impacts of both groups of large herbivores on tree establishment were largely routed through other taxa, with a negligible net effect of wild herbivores and a positive net effect of cattle on tree establishment. 4. The distinction between the (positive) net effect of cattle and (neutral) net effect of wild herbivores is due to the inclusion of browsers and mixed feeders within the assemblage of wild herbivores. Browsing by wild herbivores limited seed production, which reduced tree recruitment; grazing by cattle was more pronounced than that by wild herbivores, and thus promoted germination and subsequent establishment of small trees. 5. Our study is the first to link seed fates to tree establishment in savanna ecosystems in experimentally-manipulated herbivore communities. Further, our results highlight how large herbivores can modify a suite of independent factors - seed production, competition with understorey species, and seed and seedling predation - to collectively drive tree establishment.},

abstract = {The conservation of rare antelope has long been one of the goals of the Kruger National Park. The roan antelope  Hippotragus equinus , and to a lesser extent the tsessebe  Damaliscus lunatus , represent low-density species or rare antelope in the park. Specific management approaches representing the older equilibrium approach, have been employed to conserve these antelope. Of these, the supply of artificial water over many decades was the most resource intensive. The sudden, severe drop in the roan antelope population towards the end of the 1980s was unexpected and, retrospectively, attributed to the development of a high density of perennial waterpoints. The postulated mechanism was that the perennial presence of water allowed Burchell's zebra  Equus burchelli  to stay permanently in an area that was previously only seasonally accessible. The combined effect of a long, dry climatic cycle, high numbers of zebra and their associated predators was proposed to be the cause of this decline. As part of the new nature evolving or ecosystem resilience approach, twelve artificial waterpoints were closed in the prime roan antelope habitat in 1994 in an attempt to move the zebra out of this area. The zebra numbers declined as the rainfall increased. Closure of waterholes clearly led to redistribution of zebra numbers on the northern plains, zebra tending to avoid areas within several kilometres of closed waterpoints. However, at a larger scale, regional densities appeared similar in areas with and without closed waterpoints. There was an initial drop in the lion numbers in 1995, after which they stabilised. In spite of an improvement in the grass species composition and an increase in biomass the roan antelope population did not increase. The complexity of maintaining a population at the edge of their distribution and the problems associated with the conservation of such populations are discussed in terms of management options and monitoring approaches that may be employed in this process.},

To assess the consequences of this expansion and to describe, based on anticipated population growth rates and land accessibility, the dynamics of agricultural land-use, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based ALADYN model of agricultural land use in the savannah around Kita, Mali. The model is based on remote sensing data on agricultural land use and data from field surveys. The ALADYN simulations clearly demonstrate that traditional agriculture is not sustainable. Even under the optimistic scenario of a declining rate of population growth, the current agricultural practices will result in the cultivation of all available agricultural lands by 2015. Under current practices, every farm will experience a period of 1-3 years every 15-20 years, during which field fertility will be too low to allow cultivation. Thus, to avoid severe food shortage, emigration or alternative sources of food are necessary. Comparison of the model and remote sensing data reveals that already in 2003 the cultivated part of the study area is lower than projected. That is, farmers anticipate overexploitation and, most probably, emigrate from the area. The model highlights the great need for new agricultural practices in West Africa.},

abstract = {1. Movement data provide a window – often our only window – into the cognitive, social and biological processes that underlie the behavioural ecology of animals in the wild. Robust methods for identifying and interpreting distinct modes of movement behaviour are of great importance, but complicated by the fact that movement data are complex, multivariate and dependent. Many different approaches to exploratory analysis of movement have been developed to answer similar questions, and practitioners are often at a loss for how to choose an appropriate tool for a specific question. 2. We apply and compare four methodological approaches: first passage time (FPT), Bayesian partitioning of Markov models (BPMM), behavioural change point analysis (BCPA) and a fitted multistate random walk (MRW) to three simulated tracks and two animal trajectories – a sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) tracked for 12 h and a wolf (Canis lupus) tracked for 1 year. 3. The simulations – in which, respectively, velocity, tortuosity and spatial bias change – highlight the sensitivity of all methods to model misspecification. Methods that do not account for autocorrelation in the movement variables lead to spurious change points, while methods that do not account for spatial bias completely miss changes in orientation. 4. When applied to the animal data, the methods broadly agree on the structure of the movement behaviours. Important discrepancies, however, reflect differences in the assumptions and nature of the outputs. Important trade-offs are between the strength of the a priori assumptions (low in BCPA, high in MRW), complexity of output (high in the BCPA, low in the BPMM and MRW) and explanatory potential (highest in the MRW). 5. The animal track analysis suggests some general principles for the exploratory analysis of movement data, including ways to exploit the strengths of the various methods. We argue for close and detailed exploratory analysis of movement before fitting complex movement models.},

abstract = {Deforestation is a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity, especially within global centers of endemism for plants and animals. Elevation, the major environmental gradient in mountain regions of the world, produces a rapid turnover of species, where some species may exist only in narrow elevational ranges. We use newly compiled datasets to assess the conservation impact of deforestation on threatened trees across an elevational gradient within the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. The Eastern Arc has suffered an estimated 80{\%} total loss in historical forest area and has lost 25{\%} of forest area since 1955. Forest loss has not been even across all elevations. The upper montane zone ({\textgreater}1800 m) has lost 52{\%} of its paleoecological forest area, 6{\%} since 1955. Conversely, the submontane habitat (800-1200 m) has lost close to 93{\%} of its paleoecological extent, 57{\%} since 1955. A list of 123 narrowly endemic Tanzanian Eastern Arc tree taxa with defined and restricted elevational ranges was compiled and analyzed in regard to mountain block locations, elevational range, and area of forest within each 100 m elevational band. Half of these taxa have lost more than 90{\%} of paleoecological forest habitat in their elevational range. When elevational range is considered, 98 (80{\%}) of these endemic forest trees should have their level of extinction threat elevated on the IUCN Red List. Conservation efforts in montane hotspots need to consider the extent of habitat changes both within and across elevations and target conservation and restoration efforts throughout these ecosystems' entire elevational ranges. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Small reserves are especially likely to lose species. Is that because the reserves are small, or because small reserves are located in especially adverse landscapes? It seems that the question has rarely, if ever, been asked. Data on reserve size and location in Africa, and calculations of local (within 50 km) mean human densities from available census records per province per country were the database here used to answer the question. IUCN grade I and II reserves in Africa are located across the range of human densities per country, including in regions of higher than average density. Furthermore reserve size correlates with local human density, such that small reserves are indeed significantly more likely than are large reserves to be located in regions of high human density (n = 169; P {\textless} 0.0001). However, while local human density correlates significantly with human-caused mortality of carnivores (the only taxon for which we had data), it does not correlate with detected extinctions in reserves in east Africa (the only region with available data). Rather, area of reserve is the main predictor. Nevertheless, abundant other evidence of the adverse effects of high human density on persistence of species and wilderness indicates that we need to take as a warning the findings reported here that small reserves occur in regions of high human density, and that human density correlates with human-caused mortality. They indicate that small reserves might face the double jeopardy of both their small size, and also their situation in especially hostile surroundings. In effect, small reserves are more isolated in more adverse habitat than current analyses in conservation biology, landscape ecology, or metapopulation analysis usually indicate.},

abstract = {A meaningful interpretation of landscape metrics is possible only when the limitations of each measure are fully understood, the range of attainable values is known, and the user is aware of potential shifts in the range of values due to characteristics of landscape patches. To examine the behavior of landscape metrics, we generated artificial landscapes that mimicked fragmentation processes while controlling the size and shape of patches in the landscape and the mode of disturbance growth. We developed nine series of increasingly fragmented landscapes and used these to investigate the behavior of edge density, contagion, mean nearest neighbor distance, mean proximity index, perimeter-area fractal dimension, and mass fractal dimension. We found that most of the measures were highly correlated, especially contagion and edge density, which had a near-perfect inverse correspondence. Many of the measures were linearly-associated with increasing disturbance until the proportion of disturbance on the landscape was approximately 0.40, with non-linear associations at higher proportions. None of the measures was able to differentiate between landscape patterns characterized by dispersed versus aggregated patches. The highest attainable value of each measure was altered by either patch size or shape, and in some cases, by both attributes. We summarize our findings by discussing the utility of each metric.},

abstract = {Knowledge of mammal migrations is low, and human impacts on migrations high. This jeopardizes efforts to conserve terrestrial migrations. To aid the conservation of these migrations, we synthesized information worldwide, describing 24 large-bodied ungulates that migrate in aggregations. This synthesis includes maps of extinct and extant migrations, numbers of migrants, summaries of ecological drivers and threats migrants confront. As data are often lacking, we outlined steps for science to address and inform conservation actions. We evaluated migrants against this framework, and reported their status. Mass migrations for 6 species are extinct or unknown. Most remaining migrants (n = 9) occur from 6 locations in Africa, with Eurasia and North America containing 6 and 4 remaining mass migrants, respectively (with caribou/reindeer Rangifer tarandus occurring in both regions). All migrants declined in abundance, except wildebeest and other migrants in the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem (SME), white-eared kob and tiang in Sudan, and some caribou populations. Protected areas only contain migrations for 5 species in the SME, chiru on the Tibetan Plateau, and some caribou populations in North America. Most mass migrants track the seasonal and shifting patterns of greening vegetation over expanses of savannahs, steppes, and grasslands. Principal threats include overhunting and habitat loss from livestock, agriculture, and fencing that excludes animals from forage or water. Conservation science overlooks numerous migrations, so many have already disappeared and continue to do so. Key principles for conserving migrants, exemplified by the SME and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), include securing seasonal ranges, resource protection, government support and minimizing fences. This review forms a baseline for initiating conservation action for many ungulate migrations needing attention.},

abstract = {Although bio-logging can benefit both science and animal welfare, its applica- tion involves procedures that can cause animals pain, suffering and distress. It is essential— for both animal welfare and good science—to identify all sources of potential suffering asso- ciated with bio-logging and then to minimise suffering and improve welfare. This paper sum- marises key welfare concerns regarding wild animal studies, taken from a new report on refinements in bio-logging that covers both field and laboratory projects. Many welfare concerns apply to both laboratory and field studies, but wild animals can experience additional psychological stress due to capture and handling by humans. The phys- iological impact of devices can also be more significant for wild animals, and opportunities to monitor instrumented wild animals following their release are greatly reduced. The report includes recommendations that aim to reduce the impact of bio-logging on wild animals. It addresses refinements in the following areas: surgery, including pain relief; device attachment; releasing animals following surgery or attachment; device impact, including mass, shape and location; and information sharing to promote good practices in experimen- tal protocols. All of these will help to prevent avoidable animal suffering in future projects.},

abstract = {Trade-offs between predation risk and forage fundamentally drive resource selection by animals. Among migratory ungulates, trade-offs can occur at large spatial scales through migration, which allows an "escape" from predation, but trade-offs can also occur at finer spatial scales. Previous authors suggest that ungulates will avoid predation risk at the largest scale, although few studies have examined multi-scale trade-offs to test for the relative benefits of risk avoidance across scales. Building on previously developed spatial models of forage and wolf predation risk, we tested for trade-offs at the broad landscape scale and at a finer, within-home-range scale for migratory and non-migratory resident elk (Cervus elaphus) during summer in the Canadian Rockies in Banff National Park (BNP) and adjacent Alberta, Canada. Migration reduced exposure to wolf predation risk by 70{\%} relative to residents at the landscape scale; at the fine scale, migrants used areas that were, on average, 6{\%} higher in forage digestibility. In contrast, by forgoing migration, resident elk were exposed to higher predation risk, but they reduced predation risk at fine scales to only 15{\%} higher than migrants by using areas close to human activity, which wolves avoided. Thus, residents paid for trying to avoid predation risk with lower forage quality. Residents may have been able to compensate, however, by using areas of abundant forage close to human activity where they may have been able to forage more selectively while avoiding predation risk. Human activity effectively decoupled the positive correlation between high forage quality and wolf predation, providing an effective alternate strategy for residents, similar to recent findings in other systems. Although ungulates appear capable of balancing risk and forage at different spatial scales, risk avoidance at large landscape scales may be more effective in the absence of human-caused refugia from predation.},

abstract = {Halting the loss of biodiversity comes along with the need to quantify biodiversity composition and dynamics at large spatial and temporal scales. Highly standardized, international monitoring networks would be ideal, but they do not exist yet. If we are to assess changes in biodiversity now, combining output available from ongoing monitoring initiatives is the only option. However, integration of biodiversity information across schemes is still very poorly developed. In this paper, we outline practical issues to be considered when planning to combine existing monitoring information. First, we provide an overview of avenues for integration along the four dimensions that characterize a monitoring design: sample size, biological coverage, spatial coverage and temporal coverage. We also emphasize that complementarity in monitoring targets across schemes enables to describe complex processes of biodiversity dynamics, e.g. through relating species traits to the impacts of environmental changes. Second, we review some methods to overcome differences in designs among monitoring schemes, such as site selection, post-stratification and measurement error. Finally, we point out some commonly used statistical methods that are at hand for combining data or parameter estimates. We especially emphasize the possible levels of data integration (raw data, parameter estimates, or effect size estimates), and the largely under-exploited potential of meta-analysis methods and weighted analyses. This contribution aims to bolster the practice and use of integration of ongoing monitoring initiatives for biodiversity assessment.},

abstract = {The Bohemian Forest Ecosystem encompasses various wildlife management systems. Two large, contiguous national parks (one in Germany and one in the Czech Republic) form the centre of the area, are surrounded by private hunting grounds, and hunting regulations in each country differ. Here we aimed at unravelling the influence of management-related and environmental factors on the distribution of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in this ecosystem. We used the standing crop method based on counts of pellet groups, with point counts every 100 m along 218 randomly distributed transects. Our analysis, which accounted for overdispersion as well as zero inflation and spatial autocorrelation, corroborated the view that both human management and the physical and biological environment drive ungulate distribution in mountainous areas in Central Europe. In contrast to our expectations, protection by national parks was the least important variable for red deer and the third important out of four variables for roe deer; protection negatively influenced roe deer distribution in both parks and positively influenced red deer distribution in Germany. Country was the most influential variable for both red and roe deer, with higher counts of pellet groups in the Czech Republic than in Germany. Elevation, which indicates increasing environmental harshness, was the second most important variable for both species. Forest cover was the least important variable for roe deer and the third important variable for red deer; the relationship for roe deer was positive and linear, and optimal forest cover for red deer was about 70{\%} within a 500 m radius. Our results have direct implications for the future conservation management of deer in protected areas in Central Europe and show in particular that large non-intervention zones may not cause agglomerations of deer that could lead to conflicts along the border of protected, mountainous areas.},

abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950-2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

abstract = {In this study, we explored the capacity of vegetation indices derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance products to characterize global savannas in Australia, Africa and South America. The savannas were spatially defined and subdivided using the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) global ecoregions andMODIS land cover classes. Average annual profiles of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, shortwave infrared ratio (SWIR32), White Sky Albedo (WSA) and the Structural Scattering Index (SSI) were created. Metrics derived from average annual profiles of vegetation indices were used to classify savanna ecoregions. The response spaces between vegetation indices were used to examine the potential to derive structural and fractional cover measures. The ecoregions showed distinct temporal profiles and formed groups with similar structural properties, including higher levels of woody vegetation, similar forest– savanna mixtures and similar grassland predominance. The potential benefits from the use of combinations of indices to characterize savannas are discussed.},

abstract = {The global savanna biome is characterized by enormous diversity in the physiognomy and spatial structure of the vegetation. The foliage clumping index can be calculated from bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data. It measures the response of the darkspot reflectance to increased shadow associated with clumped vegetation and is related to leaf area index. Clumping index theoretically declines with increasing woody cover until the tree canopy begins to become uniform. In this study, clumping index is calculated for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer BRDF data for the Australian tropical savanna, the tropical savannas of South America, and the tropical savannas of east, west and southern Africa and compared with site-based measurements of tree canopy cover, and with area-based classifications of land cover. There were differences in sensitivity of clumping index between red and near-infrared reflectance channels, and between savanna systems with markedly different woody vegetation physiognomy. Clumping index was broadly related to foliage cover from historical site data in Australia and in West Africa and Kenya, but not in Southern Africa nor with detailed site-based demographic data in the cerrado of Brazil. However, clumping index decreased with proportion of woody cover in land cover datasets for east Africa, Australia and the Colombian Llanos. There was overlap in the range of clumping index values for forest, cerrado and campo land covers in Brazil. Clumping index was generally negatively correlated with percentage tree cover from the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product, but regional differences in the relationship were evident. There were large differences in the frequency distributions of clumping index from savanna, woody savanna and grassland land cover classes between global ecoregions. The clumping index shows differing sensitivity to savanna woody cover for red and NIR reflectance, and requires regional calibration for application as a universal indicator. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Ongoing climate change is assumed to be exceptional because of its unprecedented velocity. However, new geophysical research suggests that dramatic climatic changes during the Late Pleistocene occurred extremely rapid, over just a few years. These abrupt climatic changes may have been even faster than contemporary ones, but relatively few continent-wide extinctions of species have been documented for these periods. This raises questions about the ability of extant species to adapt to ongoing climate change. We propose that the advances in geophysical research challenge current views about species' ability to cope with climate change, and that lessons must be learned for modelling future impacts of climate change on species. -� 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd},

abstract = {Previous studies show that conservation actions have prevented extinctions, recovered populations, and reduced declining trends in global biodiversity. However, all studies to date have substantially underestimated the difference conservation action makes because they failed to account fully for what would have happened in the absence thereof. We undertook a scenario-based thought experiment to better quantify the effect conservation actions have had on the extinction risk of the world's 235 recognized ungulate species. We did so by comparing species' observed conservation status in 2008 with their estimated status under counterfactual scenarios in which conservation efforts ceased in 1996. We estimated that without conservation at least 148 species would have deteriorated by one International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List category, including 6 species that now would be listed as extinct or extinct in the wild. The overall decline in the conservation status of ungulates would have been nearly 8 times worse than observed. This trend would have been greater still if not for conservation on private lands. While some species have benefited from highly targeted interventions, such as reintroduction, most benefited collaterally from conservation such as habitat protection. We found that the difference conservation action makes to the conservation status of the world's ungulate species is likely to be higher than previously estimated. Increased, and sustained, investment could help achieve further improvements.},

The sites included boreal forest, temperature coniferous forest, temperate deciduous forest, tropical rainforest, grassland, savanna, and desert biomes. Differences and similarities in sensitivity to vegetation conditions were compared among various spectral vegetation indices (VIs). All VIs showed a qualitative relationship to variations in vegetation. However, there were significant differences among the VIs over desert, grassland, and forested biomes. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was sensitive to and responded primarily to the highly absorbing red reflectance band, while other indices such as the soil and atmosphere resistant vegetation index (SARVI) were more responsive to variations in the near-infrared (NIR) band. As a result, we found the NDVI to mimic red reflectances and saturate over the forested sites while the SARVI, by contrast, did not saturate and followed variations in NIR reflectances. In the arid and semiarid biomes, the NDVI was much more sensitive to canopy background variations than the SARVI. Maximum differences among vegetation index behavior occurred over the evergreen needleleaf forest sites relative to the deciduous broadleaf forests and drier, grassland, and shrub sites. These differences appear to be useful in complementing the NDVI for improved monitoring of vegetation, with the NDVI sensitive to fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation and the SARVI more sensitive to structural canopy parameters such as leaf area index and leaf morphology.},

abstract = {Vegetation is sparsely distributed over Antarctica's ice-free ground, and distinct plant communities are present in each of the continent's 15 recently identified Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (ACBRs). With rapidly increasing human activity in Antarctica, terrestrial plant communities are at risk of damage or destruction by trampling, overland transport, and infrastructure construction and from the impacts of anthropogenically introduced species, as well as uncontrollable pressures such as fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) activity and climate change. Under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, the conservation of plant communities can be enacted and facilitated through the designation of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs). We examined the distribution within the 15 ACBRs of the 33 ASPAs whose explicit purpose includes protecting macroscopic terrestrial flora. We completed the first survey using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) satellite remote sensing to provide baseline data on the extent of vegetation cover in all ASPAs designated for plant protection in Antarctica. Large omissions in the protection of Antarctic botanical diversity were found. There was no protection of plant communities in 6 ACBRs, and in another 6, {\textless}0.4{\%} of the ACBR area was included in an ASPA that protected vegetation. Protected vegetation cover within the 33 ASPAs totaled 16.1 km(2) for the entire Antarctic continent; over half was within a single protected area. Over 96{\%} of the protected vegetation was contained in 2 ACBRs, which together contributed only 7.8{\%} of the continent's ice-free ground. We conclude that Antarctic botanical diversity is clearly inadequately protected and call for systematic designation of ASPAs protecting plant communities by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, the members of the governing body of the continent.},

A high proportion (65{\{}{\%}{\}}) were found to be positive towards the concept of conservation though fewer were positive towards the Conservation Area and its managers. The distribution of attitudes in the community was cross-tabulated against 14 demographic variables. It was found that positive attitudes tended to increase with increasing household affluence and with the respondent's level of education. The most and the least westernised households tended to be positive towards conservation, suggesting the influence of a traditional concept of conservation. That households which had experienced direct benefits from the Conservation Area were more positive than those which had not indicates the importance of allowing local people access to wildlife resources and of encouraging structures to integrate conservation areas within local economies. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {Movement of organisms is one of the key mechanisms shaping biodiversity, e.g. the distribution of genes, individuals and species in space and time. Recent technological and conceptual advances have improved our ability to assess the causes and consequences of individual movement, and led to the emergence of the new field of 'movement ecology'. Here, we outline how movement ecology can contribute to the broad field of biodiversity research, i.e. the study of processes and patterns of life among and across different scales, from genes to ecosystems, and we propose a conceptual framework linking these hitherto largely separated fields of research. Our framework builds on the concept of movement ecology for individuals, and demonstrates its importance for linking individual organismal movement with biodiversity. First, organismal movements can provide 'mobile links' between habitats or ecosystems, thereby connecting resources, genes, and processes among otherwise separate locations. Understanding these mobile links and their impact on biodiversity will be facilitated by movement ecology, because mobile links can be created by different modes of movement (i.e., foraging, dispersal, migration) that relate to different spatiotemporal scales and have differential effects on biodiversity. Second, organismal movements can also mediate coexistence in communities, through 'equalizing' and 'stabilizing' mechanisms. This novel integrated framework provides a conceptual starting point for a better understanding of biodiversity dynamics in light of individual movement and space-use behavior across spatiotemporal scales. By illustrating this framework with examples, we argue that the integration of movement ecology and biodiversity research will also enhance our ability to conserve diversity at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels.},

abstract = {The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) has been found useful in improving linearity with biophysical vegetation properties and in reducing saturation effects found in densely vegetated surfaces, commonly encountered in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). However, EVI requires a blue band and is sensitive to variations in blue band reflectance, which limits consistency of EVI across different sensors. The objectives of this study are to develop a 2-band EVI (EVI2) without a blue band that has the best similarity with the 3-band EVI, and to investigate the crosssensor continuity of the EVI2 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). A linearity-adjustment factor ({\ss}) was introduced and coupled with the soil adjustment factor (L) used in the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) in the development of the EVI2 equation. The similarity between EVI and EVI2 was validated at the global scale. After a linear adjustment, the AVHRR EVI2 was found to be comparable with the MODIS EVI2. The good agreement between the AVHRR and MODIS EVI2 suggests the possibility of extending the current MODIS EVI time series to the historical AVHRR data, providing another longterm vegetation record different from the NDVI counterpart.},

abstract = {Vegetation indices and transformations have been used extensively in forest change detection studies. In this study, we processed multitemporal normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and tasseled cap wetness (TCW) data sets and compared their statistical relationships and relative efficiencies in detecting forest disturbances associated with forest type and harvest intensity at five, two and one year Landsat acquisition intervals. The NDMI and TCW were highly correlated ({\textgreater}0.95 r2) for all five image dates. There was no significant difference between TCW and NDMI for detecting forest disturbance. Using either a NDMI or TCW image differencing method, when Landsat image acquisitions were 5 years apart, clear cuts could be detected with nearly equal accuracy compared to images collected 2 years apart. Partial cuts had much higher commission and omission errors compared to clear cut. Both methods had 7-8{\%} higher commission and 12-22{\%} higher omission error to detect hardwood disturbance when it occurred in the first year of the 2-year interval (as compared to 1-year interval). Softwood and hardwood change detection errors were slightly higher at 2-year Landsat acquisition intervals compared to 1-year interval. For images acquired 1 and 2 years apart, NDMI forest disturbance commission and omission errors were slightly lower than TCW. The NDMI can be calculated using any sensor that has near-infrared and shortwave bands and is at least as accurate as TCW for detecting forest type and intensity disturbance in biomes similar to the Maine forest, particularly when Landsat images are acquired less than 2 years apart. Where partial cutting is the most dominant harvesting system as is currently the case in northern Maine, we recommend images collected every year to minimize (particularly omission) errors. However, where clear cuts or nearly complete canopy removal occurs, Landsat intervals of up to 5 years may be nearly as accurate in detecting forest change as 1 or 2 year intervals. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Maintaining ecological connectivity between Protected Areas (PAs) is one of the key environmental challenges facing Tanzania today. In south-central Tanzania, the geographically disjunct Rungwa-Ruaha, Udzungwa and Selous-Mikumi PAs have probably been connected for several centuries through the movements of large mammals, including elephants and, until recently, the Endangered African wild dog. We have investigated current connectivity among these areas and the feasibility of protecting wildlife corridors. We used a combination of methods including ground surveys (both rapid surveys and systematic transects), questionnaires with community members, satellite and aerial data. In the Kilombero Valley, most of the corridors between the Udzungwa and the Selous have been closed off in recent decades as a result of rapid human immigration and widespread changes in land use. Today, no more than two active corridors might remain, though they are seriously threatened and will probably be closed soon unless urgent interventions are taken. We also found evidence for corridors between the Udzungwa, Mikumi and Ruaha ecosystems, and the continued use of these unprotected areas by a surprising diversity of large mammals. Key areas include the Rubeho Mountains, which elephants are entering from the Ruaha-Mbuyuni area to the west and possibly from Mikumi National Park to the east and, and the Ruaha Game Controlled Area north of the Ruaha River in Mpwapwa district of Dodoma region. In all of these places there are increasing human-wildlife conflicts as the options for migrating animals are reduced. Protecting corridors for large mammals is a complex issue, involving a mosaic of habitats and land use types, including settlements and other areas of varying legal and protective status. Management efforts therefore require a flexible approach, strong commitment from communities towards improved land use planning and implementation, including set-aside Corridor areas, and dedicated coordination between all stakeholders of each Corridor area.},

abstract = {The apparent increase in elephant Loxodonta africana numbers in northern Botswana is of concern because it may affect other species. We compared changes in population growth rates based on elephant numbers and densities over 1973{\&}{\#}8211;2004. Population estimates and survey details extracted from published and unpublished sources allowed us to calculate growth rates. From 1973 to 1993 growth rate was positive when based on elephant numbers but did not differ from zero when calculated for densities. This discrepancy may be because of the significant increase in survey area during the same period. In contrast, none of the growth rates differed from zero for time series between 1996 and 2004, when the size of the survey area varied little. We propose two explanations for these results. The first suggests that the population did not grow, while the second proposes that the population expanded its range and increased in size. Notwithstanding, an equilibrium model best explained the variance in dry season estimates of elephant numbers for the complete time series. Such apparent density-dependence could be disrupted by any artificial reduction of numbers through culling as a management option in northern Botswana.},

abstract = {Long-distance migrations of wildlife have been identified as important biological phenomena, but their conservation remains a major challenge. The Mongolian Gobi is one of the last refuges for the Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus) and other threatened migratory mammals. Using historic and current distribution ranges, population genetics, and telemetry data we assessed the connectivity of the wild ass population in the context of natural and anthropogenic landscape features and the existing network of protected areas. In the Mongolian Gobi mean biomass production is highly correlated with human and livestock density and seems to predict wild ass occurrence at the upper level. The current wild ass distribution range largely falls into areas below the 250gC/m2/year productivity isoline, suggesting that under the present land use more productive areas have become unavailable for wild asses. Population genetics results identified two subpopulations and delineated a genetic boundary between the Dzungarian and Transaltai Gobi for which the most likely explanation are the mountain ranges separating the two areas. Home ranges and locations of 19 radiomarked wild asses support the assumed restricting effects of more productive habitats and mountain ranges and additionally point towards a barrier effect of fences. Furthermore, telemetry data shows that in the Dzungarian and Transaltai Gobi individual wild ass rarely ventured outside of the protected areas, whereas in the southeast Gobi asses only spend a small fraction of their time within the protected area network. Conserving the continuity of the wild ass population will need a landscape level approach, also including multi-use landscapes outside of protected areas, particularly in the southeast Gobi. In the southwest Gobi, allowing for openings in the border fence to China and managing the border area as an ecological corridor would connect three large protected areas together covering over 70,000km2 of wild ass habitat. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1. Wind power is a fast-growing industry with broad potential to impact volant wildlife. Flight altitude is a key determinant of the risk to wildlife from modern horizontal-axis wind turbines, which typically have a rotor-swept zone of 50–150 m above the ground. 2. We used altitudinal GPS data collected from golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos tracked using satellite telemetry to evaluate the potential impacts of wind turbines on eagles and other raptors along migratory routes. Eagle movements during migration were classified as local (1–5 km h 1) or migratory ({\textgreater}10 km h 1) and were characterized based on the type of terrain over which each bird was flying, and the bird's distance from wind resources preferred for energy development. 3. Birds engaged in local movements turned more frequently and flew at lower altitude than during active migration. This flight behaviour potentially exposes them to greater risk of collision with turbines than when engaged in longer-distance movements. 4. Eagles flew at relatively lower altitude over steep slopes and cliffs (sites where orographic lift can develop) than over flats and gentle slopes (sites where thermal lift is more likely). 5. Eagles predominantly flew near to wind resources preferred by energy developers, and locally moving eagles flew closer to those wind resources with greater frequency than eagles in active migration. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our research outlines the general effects of topography on raptor flight altitude and demonstrates how topography can interact with raptor migration behaviour to drive a potential human–wildlife conflict resulting from wind energy development. Management of risk to migratory species from industrial-scale wind turbines should consider the behavioural differences between both locally moving and actively migrating individuals. Additionally, risk assessment for wind energy–wildlife interactions should incorporate the consequences of topography on the flight altitude of potentially impacted wildlife.},

abstract = {When characterizing the processes that shape ecosystems, ecologists increasingly use the unique perspective offered by repeat observations of remotely sensed imagery. However, the concept of change embodied in much of the traditional remote-sensing literature was primarily limited to capturing large or extreme changes occurring in natural systems, omitting many more subtle processes of interest to ecologists. Recent technical advances have led to a fundamental shift toward an ecological view of change. Although this conceptual shift began with coarser-scale global imagery, it has now reached users of Landsat imagery, since these datasets have temporal and spatial characteristics appropriate to many ecological questions. We argue that this ecologically relevant perspective of change allows the novel characterization of important dynamic processes, including disturbances, longterm trends, cyclical functions, and feedbacks, and that these improvements are already facilitating our understanding of critical driving forces, such as climate change, ecological interactions, and economic pressures},

The aerial survey suggested that zebra and wildebeest concentrate along the river during the dry seasons, then at the pans in the wet seasons. Road surveys showed, that when analysed year by year, the aforesaid seasonal movements between the river and the pans may not be strictly adhered to.

abstract = {Land-use change is considered a major driver of biodiversity loss. In the western part of the Tarangire–Manyara ecosystem, we assessed large mammal species richness along a land-use gradient (national park, uninhabited pastoral area and settled pastoral- and farmland). We found the highest species richness in the national park and in the pastoral area and lowest species richness in the settled and farmed area. There was little evidence of seasonal changes in species diversity. Except for top-order carnivores, all functional feeding guilds were still represented in pastoral and settled areas. Although we did not find significant differences in body mass distributions and species' representation of feeding guilds between the study sites, there was a trend that omnivores, mesopredators and top-order carnivores tended to occur at lower species richness in agricultural areas than in the pastoral and fully protected areas. These results indicate that areas used for livestock keeping can maintain high wildlife species richness and that direct and indirect effects of agricultural and settlement expansions are the main drivers of species richness loss in the Tarangire–Manyara ecosystem and possibly other African savannah ecosystems. These results are useful for informed land-use planning that aims to maintain species diversity and ecological connectivity between protected areas.

The east and centre are more utilized than the west (Penny- cuick, 1974; Watson {\&} Kerfoot, 1964), despite a shorter timespan of ‘suitability', i.e. green grass and water availability, due to rainfall and soil type. Anderson {\&} Talbot (1965) have suggested that the function of this habitat selection is related to differences in soil stickiness and in growth stage and form of grasses. Grass height may also be involved, as suggested by findings on feeding adaptations (Bell, 1969) and as grass height is probably related to safety. None of these factors, however, seems to have ultimate importance, firstly because wildebeest move to the east as soon as it provides green grass and water, regardless of the condition of the soil and vegetation in the west (Braun, 1971; Watson {\&} Kerfoot, 1964), and secondly because the differences in grass height and structure which often but not always exist, are largely the result of the difference in grazing pressure (Schmidt, 1975). A conceivable function of the selective use of the east is the acquisition of an adequate supply of certain nutrients, particularly because a high demand exists, for lactation, during the utilization period of the plains. Preliminary evaluation of grass productivity and protein data of Braun (1973) and of protein, energy, digestibility, Na, Ca, Mg, P, Co, Cu, Mo, Zn and F data from grass and drinking water collected by the author, revealed that calcium indeed might be involved, but none of the other nutrients.

abstract = {Context: This paper describes the environmental consequences of agricultural adaptation on eutrophication of the nearby ecological network for a study area in the Netherlands. More specifically, we explored (i) likely responses of farmers to changes in climate, technology, policy, and markets; (ii) subsequent changes in nitrogen (N) emissions in responses to farmer adaptations; and (iii) to what extent the emitted N was deposited in nearby nature reserves, in view of the potential impacts on plant species diversity and desired nature targets. Methods: For this purpose, a spatially-explicit study at landscape level was performed by integrating the environmental model INITIATOR, the farm model FSSIM, and the land-use model RULEX. We evaluated two alternative scenarios of change in climate, technology, policy, and markets for 2050: one in line with a ‘global economy' (GE) storyline and the other in line with a ‘regional communities' (RC) storyline. Results: Results show that the GE storyline resulted in a relatively strong increase in agricultural production compared to the RC storyline. Despite the projected conversions of agricultural land to nature (as part of the implementation of the National Ecological Network), we project an increase in N losses and N deposition due to N emissions in the study area of about 20 {\%}. Even in the RC storyline, with a relatively modest increase in agricultural production and a larger expansion of the nature reserve, the N losses and deposition remain at the current level, whereas a reduction is required. Conclusions: We conclude that more ambitious green policies are needed in view of nature protection.},

This article tracks some of the major myths on driving forces of land-cover change and proposes alternative pathways of change that are better supported by case study evidence. Cases reviewed support the conclusion that neither population nor poverty alone constitute the sole and major underlying causes of land-cover change worldwide. Rather, peoples' responses to economic opportunities, as mediated by institutional factors, drive land-cover changes. Opportunities and constraints for new land uses are created by local as well as national markets and policies. Global forces become the main determinants of land-use change, as they amplify or attenuate local factors. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Corridors are popular conservation tools because they are thought to allow animals to safely move between habitat fragments, thereby maintaining landscape connectivity. Nonetheless, few studies show that mammals actually use corridors as predicted. Further, the assumptions underlying corridor models are rarely validated with field data. We categorized corridor use as a behavior, to identify animal-defined corridors, using movement data from fishers (Martes pennanti) tracked near Albany, New York, USA. We then used least-cost path analysis and circuit theory to predict fisher corridors and validated the performance of all three corridor models with data from camera traps. Six of eight fishers tracked used corridors to connect the forest patches that constitute their home ranges, however the locations of these corridors were not well predicted by the two cost-basedmodels, which together identified only 5 of the 23 used corridors. Further, camera trap data suggest the cost-based corridor models performed poorly, often detecting fewer fishers and mammals than nearby habitat cores, whereas camera traps within animal-defined corridors recorded more passes made by fishers, carnivores, and all other nontarget mammal groups. Our results suggest that (1) fishers use corridors to connect disjunct habitat fragments, (2) animalmovement data can be used to identify corridors at local scales, (3) camera traps are useful tools for testing corridor model predictions, and (4) that corridor models can be improved by incorporating animal behavior data. Given the conservation importance and monetary costs of corridors, improving and validating corridor model predictions is vital.},

abstract = {The number and extent of roads will expand dramatically this century. Globally, at least 25 million kilometres of new roads are anticipated by 2050; a 60{\%} increase in the total length of roads over that in 2010. Nine-tenths of all road construction is expected to occur in developing nations, including many regions that sustain exceptional biodiversity and vital ecosystem services. Roads penetrating into wilderness or frontier areas are a major proximate driver of habitat loss and fragmentation, wildfires, overhunting and other environmental degradation, often with irreversible impacts on ecosystems. Unfortunately, much road proliferation is chaotic or poorly planned, and the rate of expansion is so great that it often overwhelms the capacity of environmental planners and managers. Here we present a global scheme for prioritizing road building. This large-scale zoning plan seeks to limit the environmental costs of road expansion while maximizing its benefits for human development, by helping to increase agricultural production, which is an urgent priority given that global food demand could double by mid-century. Our analysis identifies areas with high environmental values where future road building should be avoided if possible, areas where strategic road improvements could promote agricultural development with relatively modest environmental costs, and /`conflict areas/' where road building could have sizeable benefits for agriculture but with serious environmental damage. Our plan provides a template for proactively zoning and prioritizing roads during the most explosive era of road expansion in human history.},

abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa, dozens of major "development corridors" have been proposed or are being created to increase agricultural production [1-4], mineral exports [5-7], and economic integration. The corridors involve large-scale expansion of infrastructure such as roads, railroads, pipelines, and port facilities and will open up extensive areas of land to new environmental pressures [1, 4, 8]. We assessed the potential environmental impacts of 33 planned or existing corridors that, if completed, would total over 53,000 km in length and crisscross much of the African continent. We mapped each corridor and estimated human occupancy (using the distribution of persistent night-lights) and environmental values (endangered and endemic vertebrates, plant diversity, critical habitats, carbon storage, and climate-regulation services) inside a 50-km-wide band overlaid onto each corridor. We also assessed the potential for each corridor to facilitate increases in agricultural production. The corridors varied considerably in their environmental values, and many were only sparsely populated. Because of marginal soils or climates, some corridors appear to have only modest agricultural potential. Collectively, the corridors would bisect over 400 existing protected areas and could degrade a further ???1,800 by promoting habitat disruption near or inside the reserves. We conclude that many of the development corridors will promote serious and largely irreversible environmental changes and should proceed only if rigorous mitigation and protection measures can be employed. Some planned corridors with high environmental values and limited agricultural benefits should possibly be cancelled altogether. Video Abstract: Display Omitted. Laurance et al. assess the potential environmental costs of 33 planned or progressing "development corridors" in Africa. If completed, the corridors would total over 53,000 km in length and are likely to imperil many African ecosystems.

abstract = {Avoidance of roads has been demonstrated for many animal species, but little is known about the relationship between anthropogenic disturbance levels and the degree of avoidance by animals. We investigated the hypothesis that the strength of road-avoidance behaviour increases with the intensity of the disturbance for a large, disturbance-sensitive herbivore: the forest-dwelling caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou. We assessed the behaviour of 53 global positioning system-collared caribou monitored during the gradual modification of a highway over a 7-year period, while controlling for potentially confounding factors. We studied caribou movements, resource selection and distribution before, during and after road modifications at multiple scales. We expected that the degree of avoidance would be positively related to road width, traffic density and the presence of active construction sites. The proportion of individuals that excluded the highway from their home range increased as highway modifications progressed.Alower proportion of caribou locations was found in a 5000 m road-effect zone during and after highway modifications compared with before. Within that zone, caribou avoided habitat types that were selected at the home range scale. Caribou displayed higher movement rates in the vicinity of the highway, especially when traffic density was high. Our data support the hypothesis that avoidance of roads by large herbivores is positively related to disturbance intensity. Our results shed light on the behavioural mechanisms determining avoidance of human infrastructure by large herbivores, and suggest that increased human activity may affect behaviour at multiple scales. Conservation efforts in areas where roads are constructed or modified should be directed towards maintaining access to critical habitat resources, while also restoring habitat quantity and quality.},

abstract = {Fine-scale landscape features such as scattered trees are increasingly thought to be critical for dispersal, and need to be considered in connectivity modelling and planning. Yet existing modelling approaches struggle to adequately take fine-scale features and threshold dynamics of dispersal behaviour into account, in part because of computational limitations. We present a framework for modelling connectivity at fine spatial resolutions over large spatial extents. Our framework involves a novel approach to characterising fine-scale dispersal behaviour within the context of existing modelling methods, and uses key parameters of dispersal behaviour to link models and their interpretation at multiple scales. We address computational limitations by creating a gap-crossing threshold layer, which identifies areas where dispersal is possible because of the presence and spacing of fine-scale connectivity elements. This layer is combined with a dispersal-cost layer within a graph-network analysis to identify the optimal least-cost path between patches. Graph metrics are used to assess the importance of specific patches at the regional-scale and to describe connectivity for the whole landscape. A local-scale connectivity model using the Circuitscape software complements the regional analysis outputs by considering all possible pathways across a landscape simultaneously rather than a single least-cost path. The framework was designed specifically to be applied by land use planners who need to quantify the impacts of property development on fine-scale connectivity, yet need to assess implications at the regional scale. We demonstrate the framework by applying it in the Lower Hunter region, Australia.},

abstract = {Aim To project the potential European distribution of seven broad habitat categories (needle-leaved, broad-leaved, mixed and mediterranean forest, urban, grassland and cropland) in order to assess effects of land use, climate change and increase in CO2 on predicted habitat changes up to the year 2050. Location Europe. Method We modelled the response of European vegetation to changes in land use, climate and CO2 by combining the land-use model Dyna-CLUE (based on the CORINE land-cover data) and the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. Two reforestation options were explored: maintaining the current range of tree species (EFI) or promoting naturally occurring tree species (NAT). Climate data from two general circulation models and two SRES scenarios (A2 and B1) were used. The broad habitat types were classified according to a combination of land use and the dominant plant species. Results Our models predicted that croplands and grasslands are expected to decrease due to land-use change. Although climate change has a negative effect on needle-leaved forest, it is expected to maintain its area or even increase in the EFI reforestation option while mediterranean, broad-leaved and mixed forests are expected to increase markedly. All investigated drivers have shown some effect, but land use is the dominant contributor to broad habitat change except for needle-leaved and mixed which are mainly influenced by climate change. Main conclusions Land use is predicted to have the greatest effect on broad habitat distribution according to our simulations. Hence in most parts of Europe mitigating actions should focus on land-use change rather than climate change. According to our simulation, the effects of the different drivers are not in general additive. In some cases they act synergistically and in some cases antagonistically. The projected habitat changes are a valuable tool for species distribution modelling and are available online.},

While statistical techniques are advancing at a fast pace, there is confusion in the conceptual understanding of the meaning of various quantities that these statistical techniques provide. Terms such as selection, choice, use, occupancy and preference often are employed as if they are synonymous. Many practitioners are unclear about the distinctions between different concepts such as 'probability of selection,' 'probability of use,' 'choice probabilities' and 'probability of occupancy'. Similarly, practitioners are not always clear about the differences between and relevance of 'relative probability of selection' vs. 'probability of selection' to effective management. Practitioners also are unaware that they are using only a single statistical model for modelling resource selection, namely the exponential probability of selection, when other models might be more appropriate. Currently, such multimodel inference is lacking in the resource selection literature. In this paper, we attempt to clarify the concepts and terminology used in animal resource studies by illustrating the relationships among these various concepts and providing their statistical underpinnings.},

We evaluated habitat selection of moose in north- eastem Minnesota using telemetry locations and Land-Use Land-Cover (LULC) type information. We calculated measures of habitat selection within their home range (third-order) and selection of habitats to create a home range (second-order) using a technique called composition analysis. The analyses indicated that the Cutover cover type ranked highest in summer and winter in both second- and third- order selection and its rank generally was significantly higher than most other cover types. Selection for aquatic habitats during the summer was not evident in our analysis. Cover types that could provide lower operative temperatures from shade ranked higher than aquatic cover types. Inferences from these analyses should be treated with caution because of inherent weaknesses of use-availability analyses and biases associated with VHF telemetry locations.}},

In this paper, we review several representative localization algorithms that use time of arrivals (TOAs) and time difference of arrivals (TDOAs) to achieve high signal source position estimation accuracy when a transmitter is in the line-of-sight of a receiver. Circular (TOA) and hyperbolic (TDOA) position estimation approaches both use nonlinear equations that relate the known locations of receivers and unknown locations of transmitters. Estimation of the location of transmitters using the standard nonlinear equations may not be very accurate because of receiver location errors, receiver measurement errors, and computational efficiency challenges that result in high computational burdens. Least squares and maximum likelihood based algorithms have become the most popular computational approaches to transmitter location estimation. In this paper, we summarize the computational characteristics and position estimation accuracies of various positioning algorithms. By improving methods for estimating the time-of-arrival of transmissions at receivers and transmitter location estimation algorithms, transmitter location estimation may be applied across a range of applications and technologies such as radar,sonar, the Global Positioning System, wireless sensor networks, underwater animal tracking, mobile communications, and multimedia.},

abstract = {The IUCN Redlist considers the African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) to be "vulnerable" despite it numbering in the 100,000s and having a large geographical range. This seeming paradox stems from how quickly human persecution can eliminate elephants across large areas and how quickly elephant numbers can increase when protected. Much elephant research concentrates on the extent and consequences of elephant persecution. Where elephants thrive, two other human interventions, the provision of artificial water and the construction of fences may have large, and perhaps unintended, impacts on elephant behavior. In general, successful management requires that we understand elephant movements and land-use choices across large areas and long periods. Here, we ask specifically how artificial water and fences might affect these movements. To do this, we first characterize how elephants move in different seasons and landscape types, in different years, and how these patterns change over a region that varies considerably in annual rainfall. We fitted 73 elephants with GPS collars across a large rainfall gradient spanning seven southern African countries over a period of 6 years. We analyzed remotely-sensed environmental data from four satellite borne sensors that measure daily rainfall, weekly temperature, bi-monthly greenness, and summarise human infrastructure. Elephants move approximately 6 km/day in dry landscapes, down to approximately 3 km/day in the wettest ones. Strong seasonal differences modulate geographic differences. Elephants move less, cover less area, and are more faithful to landscapes across years in the dry season than the wet. Water availability drives these seasonal patterns. Seasonal differences in the area covered are less pronounced in wet landscapes where permanent water is more dispersed. Within-day movements reveal that elephants are consistently crepuscular but more active at night than midday when temperatures are high. Direction-changes are centered at midnight when elephants are close to water indicating regular nighttime treks to water. By design, our analyses seek to find general patterns of elephant movements - something that one can achieve only across a large range of locations and ecological conditions - in order to understand the impact of human interventions. We show that both interventions reduce seasonal differences in elephant ranging patterns and increase local impacts of elephants on the vegetation. Artificial water sources allow more extensive dry season ranging, allowing elephants to use - and potentially overexploit - vegetation in areas that would have be otherwise inaccessible to them except in the wet season. Fences cause elephants to "bunch-up" against them during the wet season, again locally increasing the pressure elephants put on their resources. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Patterns of genetic differentiation in the plains zebra (Equus quagga) were analysed using mitochondrial DNA control region variation and seven microsatellites. The six morphologically defined subspecies of plains zebra lacked the population genetic structure indicative of distinct evolutionary units. Both marker sets showed high levels of genetic variation and very low levels of differentiation. There was no geographical structuring of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in the phylogenetic tree, and the plains zebra showed the lowest overall differentiation recorded in any African ungulate studied so far. Arid-adapted African ungulates have shown significant regional genetic structuring in support of the Pleistocene refuge theory. This was not the case in the zebra, and the data are discussed in relation to the impact of Pleistocene climate change on a nonbovid member of the savannah ungulate community. The only other species showing a similar absence of genetic structuring is the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), but this taxon lacks the high levels of morphological variation present in the plains zebra.},

abstract = {Setting wildlife conservation priorities and determining how to meet them is challenging, particularly when policy decisions made at large scales need to be informed by a diversity of local conditions. The persistence of species that range widely demands that they coexist with people both within and outside formally protected areas. It is often politically and financially infeasible for one central body, such as a government wildlife agency, to monitor an entire population. Therefore, conservation planners are increasingly turning to local knowledge to inform conservation decisions. Here, we show the scientific and conservation benefits of recruiting and training local community members to collect data on an endangered species, the Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi). We recruited 18 scouts from six community-held ranches in Samburu District, Kenya. The scouts record the location, group structure and habitat of all Grevy's zebra herds seen in walking surveys. Kernel analyses of scout herd observations indicate areas heavily used by Grevy's zebra, and the subset of these areas favored by females with young foals. The important areas identified by the scouts closely match those inferred from analyses of GPS radiocollar data. Further, scout data reveals extensive spatial and temporal overlap between livestock and Grevy's zebra. This overlap suggests the potential for competition between Grevy's zebra and domestic animals. We argue that scout programs such as ours can generate valuable insights for conservation planning. In addition, such programs have the potential to improve local attitudes toward wildlife conservation. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Monitoring the locations and distributions of land-cover changes is important for establishing links between policy decisions, regulatory actions and subsequent land-use activities. Past studies incorporating two-date change detection using Landsat data have tended to be performance limited for applications in biologically complex systems. This study explored the use of 250??m multi-temporal MODIS NDVI 16-day composite data to provide an automated change detection and alarm capability on a 1??year time-step for the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuary System (APES) region of the US. Detection accuracy was assessed for 2002 at 88{\{}{\%}{\}}, with a reasonable balance between change commission errors (21.9{\{}{\%}{\}}), change omission errors (27.5{\{}{\%}{\}}), and Kappa coefficient of 0.67. Annual change detection rates across the APES over the study period (2002-2005) were estimated at 0.7{\{}{\%}{\}} per annum and varied from 0.4{\{}{\%}{\}} (2003) to 0.9{\{}{\%}{\}} (2004). Regional variations were also readily apparent ranging from 1.6{\{}{\%}{\}} to 0.1{\{}{\%}{\}} per annum for the tidal water and mountain ecological zones, respectfully. This research included the application of an automated protocol to first filter the MODIS NDVI data to remove poor (corrupted) data values and then estimate the missing data values using a discrete Fourier transformation technique to provide high-quality uninterrupted data to support the change detection analysis. The methods and results detailed in this article apply only to non-agricultural areas. Additional limitations attributed to the coarse resolution of the NDVI data included the overestimation of change area that necessitated the application of a change area correction factor. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Processes of deforestation, known to threaten tropical forest biodiversity, have not yet been studied sufficiently in East Africa. To shed light on the patterns and causes of human influences on protected forest ecosystems, comparisons of different study areas regarding land cover dynamics and potential drivers are needed. We analyze the development of land cover since the early 1970s for three protected East African rainforests and their surrounding farmlands and assess the relationship between the observed changes in the context of the protection status of the forests. Processing of Landsat satellite imagery of eight or seven time steps in regular intervals results in 12 land cover classes for the Kakamega-Nandi forests (Kenya) and Budongo Forest (Uganda) whereas ten are distinguished for Mabira Forest (Uganda). The overall classification accuracy assessed for the year 2001 or 2003 is similarly high for all three study areas (81{\%} to 85{\%}). The time series reveal that, despite their protection status, Kakamega-Nandi forests and Mabira Forest experienced major forest decrease, the first a continuous forest loss of 31{\%} between 1972/1973 and 2001, the latter an abrupt loss of 24{\%} in the late 1970s/early 1980s. For both forests, the temporally dense time series show short-term fluctuations in forest classes (e.g., areas of forest regrowth since the 1980s or exotic secondary bushland species from the 1990s onwards). Although selectively logged, Budongo Forest shows a much more stable forest cover extent. A visual overlay with population distribution for all three regions clearly indicates a relationship between forest loss and areas of high population density, suggesting population pressure as a main driver of deforestation. The revealed forest losses due to local and commercial exploitation further demonstrate that weak management impedes effective forest protection in East Africa.},

abstract = {We develop individual-based movement ecology models (MEM) to explore turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) migration decisions at both hourly and daily scales. Vulture movements in 10 migration events were recorded with satellite-reporting GPS sensors, and flight behavior was observed visually, aided by on-the-ground VHF radio-tracking. We used the North American Regional Reanalysis dataset to obtain values for wind speed, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and cloud height and used a digital elevation model for a measure of terrain ruggedness. A turkey vulture fitted with a heart-rate logger during 124 h of flight during 38 contiguous days showed only a small increase in mean heart rate as distance traveled per day increased, which suggests that, unlike flapping, soaring flight does not lead to greatly increased metabolic costs. Data from 10 migrations for 724 hourly segments and 152 daily segments showed that vultures depended heavily upon high levels of TKE in the atmospheric boundary layer to increase flight distances and maintain preferred bearings at both hourly and daily scales. We suggest how the MEM can be extended to other spatial and temporal scales of avian migration. Our success in relating model-derived atmospheric variables to migration indicates the potential of using regional reanalysis data, as here, and potentially other regional, higher-resolution, atmospheric models in predicting changing movement patterns of soaring birds under various scenarios of climate and land use change.},

abstract = {Some of the most valued natural and cultural landscapes on Earth lie in river basins that are poorly gauged and have incomplete historical climate and runoff records. The Mara River Basin of East Africa is such a basin. It hosts the internationally renowned Mara-Serengeti landscape as well as a rich mixture of indigenous cultures. The Mara River is the sole source of surface water to the landscape during the dry season and periods of drought. During recent years, the flow of the Mara River has become increasingly erratic, especially in the upper reaches, and resource managers are hampered by a lack of understanding of the relative influence of different sources of flow alteration. Uncertainties about the impacts of future climate change compound the challenges. We applied the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate the response of the headwater hydrology of the Mara River to scenarios of continued land use change and projected climate change. Under the data-scarce conditions of the basin, model performance was improved using satellite-based estimated rainfall data, which may also improve the usefulness of runoff models in other parts of East Africa. The results of the analysis indicate that any further conversion of forests to agriculture and grassland in the basin headwaters is likely to reduce dry season flows and increase peak flows, leading to greater water scarcity at critical times of the year and exacerbating erosion on hillslopes. Most climate change projections for the region call for modest and seasonally variable increases in precipitation (5-10{\%}) accompanied by increases in temperature (2.5-3.5 degrees C). Simulated runoff responses to climate change scenarios were non-linear and suggest the basin is highly vulnerable under low (-3{\%}) and high (+25{\%}) extremes of projected precipitation changes, but under median projections (+7{\%}) there is little impact on annual water yields or mean discharge. Modest increases in precipitation are partitioned largely to increased evapotranspiration. Overall, model results support the existing efforts of Mara water resource managers to protect headwater forests and indicate that additional emphasis should be placed on improving land management practices that enhance infiltration and aquifer recharge as part of a wider program of climate change adaptation.},

Also, urbanization is often more lasting than other types of habitat loss. Throughout much of New England, for exam- ple, ecological succession is restoring forest habitat lost from farming and logging, whereas most urbanized areas in that region not only persist but continue to expand and threaten other local ecosystems (Stein et al. 2000). Another great conservation challenge of urban growth is that it replaces the native species that are lost with wide- spread “weedy” nonnative species. This replacement consti- tutes the process of biotic homogenization that threatens to reduce the biological uniqueness of local ecosystems (Blair 2001).Urban-gradient studies show that, for many taxa, for example, plants (Kowarik 1995) and birds and butterflies (Blair and Launer 1997),the number of nonnative species in- creases toward centers of urbanization, while the number of native species decreases.

Range determinants at the lower level of individuals, however, can change at a relatively fast rate as they result from more rapid processes, such as the seasonal production of food or annual changes in predation rates. Not only do higher scales constrain those below but also lower level processes combine to affect higher scales. Further, correlates of home range size can differ among scales. To incorporate the possible findings of different patterns at different temporal and spatial scales we recommend using a comparative approach to complement controlled manipulative experiments},

abstract = {The relationship between individual performance and nonrandom use of habitat is fundamental to ecology; however, empirical tests of this relationship remain limited, especially for higher orders of selection like that of the home range. We quantified the association between lifetime reproductive success (LRS) and variables describing lifetime home ranges during the period of maternal care (spring to autumn) for 77 female roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) at Trois-Fontaines, Champagne-Ardenne, France (1976-2000). We maintained population growth rate (adjusted to account for removals of non-focal animals) near r(max), which enabled us to de. ne the fitness-habitat relationship in the absence of density effects. Using a negative binomial model, we showed that a roe deer's incorporation into its home range of habitat components important to food, cover, and edge (meadows, thickets, and increased density of road allowances) was significantly related to LRS. Further, LRS decreased with increasing age of naturally reclaimed meadows at the time of a deer's birth, which may have reflected a cohort effect related to, but not entirely explained by, a decline in quality of meadows through time. Predictive capacity of the selected model, estimated as the median correlation (r(s)) between predicted and observed LRS among deer of cross-validation samples, was 0.55. The strength of this relationship suggests that processes like selection of the site of a home range during dispersal may play a more important role in determining fitness of individuals than previously thought. Individual fitness of highly sedentary income breeders with high reproductive output such as roe deer should be more dependent on home range quality during the period of maternal care compared to capital breeders with low reproductive output. Identification of the most important habitat attributes to survival and reproduction at low density (low levels of intraspecific competition) may prove useful for de. ning habitat value ("intrinsic habitat value").},

abstract = {Africa's abundant large herbivores are very heterogeneously distributed, both geographically and regionally. Within a region, some localities contain dense animal concentrations although areas nearby may be virtually unoccupied. Mixed-species herds are a conspicuous feature of areas where animals concentrate. The prevailing explanations of local distributional concentrations are (1) that different herbivore species facilitate each other's foraging, and (2) that animals are protected from predation by both intraspecific and interspecific association. If facilitation of grazing were an overriding factor, mixed species herds should move extensively with localized rain showers to obtain the greatest forage yield. If predation were the major factor influencing animal densities and distributions, rapid, unpredictable spatial movements would further reduce predation. But because resident, non-migratory species tend to occupy home ranges that are stable over time, neither of these hypotheses is totally compelling. Because tropical forages are of lower quality than temperate ones and are often chronically deficient in mineral elements, I tested the hypothesis that areas where animals concentrate are localities supporting forages of higher mineral content. I report here that the mineral content of foods is an important determinant of the spatial distributions of animals within the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Based on ecological critieria, magnesium, sodium and phosphorus appear particularly important.},

abstract = {Temperature is a main driver for most ecological processes, and temperature time series provide key environmental indicators for various applications and research fields. High spatial and temporal resolutions are crucial for detailed analyses in various fields of research. A disadvantage of temperature data obtained by satellites is the occurrence of gaps that must be reconstructed. Here, we present a new method to reconstruct high-resolution land surface temperature (LST) time series at the continental scale gaining 250-m spatial resolution and four daily values per pixel. Our method constitutes a unique new combination of weighted temporal averaging with statistical modeling and spatial interpolation. This newly developed reconstruction method has been applied to greater Europe, resulting in complete daily coverage for eleven years. To our knowledge, this new reconstructed LST time series exceeds the level of detail of comparable reconstructed LST datasets by several orders of magnitude. Studies on emerging diseases, parasite risk assessment and temperature anomalies can now be performed on the continental scale, maintaining high spatial and temporal detail. We illustrate a series of applications in this paper. Our dataset is available online for download as time aggregated derivatives for direct usage in GIS-based applications.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Contraction of cardiac myocytes is initiated by Ca(2+) entry through the voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2+) channel (LTCC). Previous studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling modulates LTCC function. Because PI 3-kinases are key mediators of insulin action, we investigated whether LTCC function is affected in diabetic animals due to reduced PI 3-kinase signaling. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used whole-cell patch clamping and biochemical assays to compare cardiac LTCC function and PI 3-kinase signaling in insulin-deficient diabetic mice heterozygous for the Ins2(Akita) mutation versus nondiabetic littermates. RESULTS: Diabetic mice had a cardiac contractility defect, reduced PI 3-kinase signaling in the heart, and decreased L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) density in myocytes compared with control nondiabetic littermates. The lower I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice is due at least in part to reduced cell surface expression of the LTCC. I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice was increased to control levels by insulin treatment or intracellular infusion of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate PI(3,4,5)P(3). This stimulatory effect was blocked by taxol, suggesting that PI(3,4,5)P(3) stimulates microtubule-dependent trafficking of the LTCC to the cell surface. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of I(Ca,L) was also shifted to more positive potentials in myocytes from diabetic versus nondiabetic animals. PI(3,4,5)P(3) infusion eliminated only the difference in voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of I(Ca,L). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased PI 3-kinase signaling in myocytes from type 1 diabetic mice leads to reduced Ca(2+) entry through the LTCC, which might contribute to the negative effect of diabetes on cardiac contractility.},

abstract = {Protected areas must be close, or connected, enough to allow for the preservation of large-scale ecological and evolutionary processes, such as gene flow, migration, and range shifts in response to climate change. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether the network of protected areas in the United States is connected in a way that will preserve biodiversity over large temporal and spatial scales. It is also unclear whether protected-area networks that function for larger species will function for smaller species. We assessed the connectivity of protected areas in the three largest biomes in the United States. With methods from graph theory--a branch of mathematics that deals with connectivity and flow--we identified and measured networks of protected areas for three different groups of mammals. We also examined the value of using umbrella species (typically large-bodied, far-ranging mammals) in designing large-scale networks of protected areas. Although the total amount of protected land varied greatly among biomes in the United States, overall connectivity did not. In general, protected-area networks were well connected for large mammals but not for smaller mammals. Additionally, it was not possible to predict connectivity for small mammals on the basis of connectivity for large mammals, which suggests the umbrella species approach may not be an appropriate design strategy for conservation networks intended to protect many species. Our findings indicate different strategies should be used to increase the likelihood of persistence for different groups of species. Strategic linkages of existing lands should be a conservation priority for smaller mammals, whereas conservation of larger mammals would benefit most from the protection of more land.},

This paper describes how modern institutions and policies influence management and shape access to and utilization of resources by rural communities in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. It is rooted in the framework of adaptive co-governance within social-ecological systems, and employs a critical literature review to analyse access to and use of natural resources in rural Botswana. Prior to the establishment of community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) in Botswana in 1989, resource governance was dominated by strong traditional institutions that were responsible for natural resource management and decision-making. Contemporary natural resource governance is characterized by a bureaucratic system that invariably undermines the role of traditional institutions in natural resource governance. Findings indicate that policies and regulatory instruments deny rural communities adequate access to and utilization of resources available within their immediate environment. In spite of an orientation towards an anthropocentric approach to natural resource management (as in the case of CBNRM), the current governance system continues to undermine the inclusion of local resource users as legitimate stakeholders in the decision-making process.},

Locating and monitoring animals using tracking devices is a method commonly used for many taxa to study charac-teristics such as home-range size, habitat selection, movement patterns and other aspects of ranging behaviour. Fitting such devices requires the capture and handling of the study organism and researchers must then assume that a monitored animal behaves in a 'normal' way. We investigated whether the capture and handling of roe deer Capreolus capreolus induced behavioural alterations. In particular, we expected that the roe deer would exhibit a 'seeking a refuge and waiting before returning' strategy immediately after release, taking shelter far from the capture scene, in closed habitat, and exhibiting a reduced activity level. We evaluated the effect of capture and handling on 112 roe deer equipped with GPS collars, during a period of 50 days after release. We compared the first 10 days after release with the subsequent days for the following behavioural parameters: distance to the barycentre of their GPS fixes, presence in forest habitat, distance to the nearest forest patch, distance to a source of human disturbance, and activity level. We found pronounced differences in terms of spatial behaviour, habitat use and overall activity level between the two periods in GPS monitored roe deer. We also found differences in terms of spatial displacement between the sexes, with females responding less than males, and among age classes, with yearlings responding most and fawns least, to the capture and handling event. Finally, spatial displacement of roe deer increased with openness of the habitat due, in part, to the scarcity of available shelter in open areas. We conclude that the roe deer exhibited a strategy consisting of seeking a refuge and waiting before returning after capture, handling and fitting of a collar, with displacement to-wards a refuge habitat, in or near woodland, avoidance of sources of human disturbance and reduced activity levels. From a practical point of view, we recommend removing data during the first days of monitoring as behavioural alterations due to capture and handling may be pronounced.},

abstract = {1. In migratory populations, the degree of fidelity and dispersal among seasonal ranges is an important population process with consequences for demography, management, sensitivity to habitat change and adaptation to local environmental conditions. 2. Characterizing patterns of range fidelity in ungulates, however, has remained challenging because of the difficulties of following large numbers of marked individuals across multiple migratory cycles and of identifying the appropriate scale of analysis. 3. We examined fidelity to wet season (i.e. breeding) ranges in a recently declining population of wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus Burchell in northern Tanzania across 3 years. We used computer-assisted photographic identification and capture-recapture to characterize return patterns to three wet season ranges that were ecologically discrete and topographically isolated from one another. 4. Among 2557 uniquely identified adult wildebeest, we observed 150 recaptures across consecutive wet seasons. Between the two migratory subpopulations, the probability of remaining faithful to wet season areas ranged between 0{\textperiodcentered}82 and 1{\textperiodcentered}00. Animals from a non-migratory segment of the population (near Lake Manyara National Park) were rarely observed in other wet season ranges, despite proximity to one of the migratory pathways. 5. We found no effect of sex on an individuals' probability of switching wet season ranges. However, the breeding status of females in year i had a strong influence on patterns of range selection in year i + 1, with surviving breeders over three times as likely to switch ranges as non-breeders. 6. Social-group associations between pairs of recaptured animals were random with respect to an individual's wet season range during the previous or forthcoming wet seasons, suggesting that an individual's herd identity during the dry season does not predict wet season range selection. 7. Examining fidelity and dispersal in terrestrial migrations improves our understanding of the constraints that migrants experience when they face rapid habitat changes or fluctuations in environmental conditions.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We present the {\textless}I{\textgreater}lulcc{\textless}/I{\textgreater} software package, an object-oriented framework for land use change modelling written in the R programming language. The contribution of the work is to resolve the following limitations associated with the current land use change modelling paradigm: (1) the source code for model implementations is frequently unavailable, severely compromising the reproducibility of scientific results and making it impossible for members of the community to improve or adapt models for their own purposes; (2) ensemble experiments to capture model structural uncertainty are difficult because of fundamental differences between implementations of alternative models; and (3) additional software is required because existing applications frequently perform only the spatial allocation of change. The package includes a stochastic ordered allocation procedure as well as an implementation of the CLUE-S algorithm. We demonstrate its functionality by simulating land use change at the Plum Island Ecosystems site, using a data set included with the package. It is envisaged that lulcc will enable future model development and comparison within an open environment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Aim To demonstrate how the interrelations of individual movements form large- scale population-level movement patterns and how these patterns are associated with the underlying landscape dynamics by comparing ungulate movements across species. Locations Arctic tundra in Alaska and Canada, temperate forests in Massachu- setts, Patagonian Steppes in Argentina, Eastern Steppes in Mongolia. Methods We used relocation data from four ungulate species (barren-ground caribou, Mongolian gazelle, guanaco and moose) to examine individual move- ments and the interrelation of movements among individuals. We applied and developed a suite of spatial metrics that measure variation in movement among individuals as population dispersion,movement coordination and realized mobil- ity. Taken together, these metrics allowed us to quantify and distinguish among different large-scale population-level movement patterns such as migration, range residency and nomadism.We then related the population-levelmovement patterns to the underlying landscape vegetation dynamics via long-term remote sensing measurements of the temporal variability, spatial variability and unpredictability of vegetation productivity. Results Moose, which remained in sedentary home ranges, and guanacos, which were partially migratory, exhibited relatively short annual movements associated with landscapes having very little broad-scale variability in vegetation.Caribou and gazelle performed extreme long-distance movements that were associated with broad-scale variability in vegetation productivity during the peak of the growing season. Caribou exhibited regular seasonal migration in which individuals were clustered for most of the year and exhibited coordinated movements. In contrast, gazelle were nomadic, as individuals were independently distributed andmoved in an uncoordinated manner that relates to the comparatively unpredictable (yet broad-scale) vegetation dynamics of their landscape. Main conclusions We show how broad-scale landscape unpredictability may lead to nomadism, an understudied type of long-distancemovement. In contrast to classical migration where landscapes may vary at broad scales but in a predictable manner, long-distance movements of nomadic individuals are uncoordinated and independent from other such individuals. Landscapes with little broad-scale vari- ability in vegetation productivity feature smaller-scale movements and allow for range residency. Nomadism requires distinct integrative conservation strategies that facilitate long-distance movements across the entire landscape and are not limited to certain migration corridors.},

abstract = {1 Temporal variability in habitat suitability has important conservation and ecological implications. In grasslands, changes in resource availability can occur at broad spatial scales and enlarge area requirements of ungulate populations, which increases their vulnerability to habitat loss and fragmentation. Understanding and predicting these dynamics, although critical, has received little attention so far. 2 We investigated habitat dynamics for Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa Pallas) in the eastern steppes of Mongolia. We quantified the distribution of gazelles at four different time periods and tracked primary productivity using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from satellite imagery. 3 A second-order logistic model showed that NDVI was an efficient predictor of gazelle presence. We tested the predictive power of the model with independent data from a gazelle telemetry study: 85{\%} of all relocations were found within the predicted area. 4 Gazelles preferred an intermediate range of vegetation productivity, presumably facing quality quantity trade-offs where areas with low NDVI are limited by low ingestion rates, and areas with high NDVI are limited by the low digestibility of mature forage. 5 Spatiotemporal variation of gazelle habitat areas was high. Only 15{\%} of the study area was consistently gazelle habitat throughout all survey periods, indicating that gazelles need to range over vast areas in search of food. Only 1{\%} of the gazelle habitats were consistently located inside protected areas. 6 Synthesis and applications. Habitat variability in grasslands often leads to area requirements of ungulates that prevent effective conservation within single protected areas. They require landscape-level management plans, but dynamic habitat predictions to inform such plans are difficult to implement and are often unavailable. We showed that satellite estimates of vegetation productivity can be used successfully to generate dynamic habitat models in landscapes with highly variable resources, and demonstrated that intermediate NDVI values were critical to predict occurrence of Mongolian gazelles.},

The outbreak affected equids including the endangered Grevy's zebras (Equus grevyi), plain zebras (Equis Burchelli) and donkeys (Equus asinus). Most of the deaths were localized in Nkaroni area just west of Wamba town. The diagnosis of anthrax was rapidly confirmed by bacteriological methods. The relevant government depart- ments, including the Kenya Wildlife Service and Veterinary Department, and other stakeholders were promptly informed. Fifty-three Grevy's zebra and 26 plains zebras died from anthrax. An equal number (eighteen) of adult male and female Grevy's zebras succumbed to the disease. The outbreak affected immature and mature individuals equally. The dead plain zebras included fifteen adult fe- males, two adult males and nine immature individuals. The Veterinary Department responded by vaccinating livestock while Kenya Wildlife Service vaccinated 620 Grevy's zebras within southern Samburu. Examination of sites at which carcasses of animals which succumbed to the disease were burnt, revealed that unsupervised burning did not elimin- ate anthrax spores in 42{\%} of the cases (n ¼ 14). There is an urgent need to incorporate strategic wildlife disease monitoring in the struggle to save Grevy's zebras and other endangered species.},

abstract = {Land degradation is affecting rural livelihoods across sub-Saharan Africa. Promoting sustainable land management requires a thorough understanding of land use change drivers, processes and effects. However, in most African countries reliable data for such investigations are missing. We therefore test an integrated approach to analyse land use dynamics, combining remote sensing images, an in-depth quantitative survey, stakeholder interviews and local statistics. We analyse land dynamics and agricultural production over a 25-year period in Vihiga District, Western Kenya. Specifically, we examine how land use has changed in this period, the main drivers for land use change, and the main effects of these changes on agricultural production. Vihiga District is one of the most densely populated rural areas in Africa. We find that the district has undergone rapid land use change in the past 25. years. In particular, there has been a major conversion of forest and bare land to agricultural land use. Often, it is stated that increasing population pressure triggers agricultural intensification; however, we find little evidence of such a process in Vihiga District. Productivity of tea and, to a lesser extent, vegetables increased but the yields of maize and beans, the most common crops, fluctuated around a ton per hectare. Overall, per capita food crop production dropped by 28{\%} during the past two decades. Our study shows that high and increasing population pressures do not necessarily lead to agricultural intensification, and that there is a need to consider more explicitly off-farm income in development and land management policies and projects. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Protected areas had significantly lower rates of clearing in compar ison to their surroundings. In addition, protected areas had also significantly lowered rates of clearing within their boundary following initiation of protection. Thus, protect ed areas do appear to be effective at limiting overall land cover clearing. There was some variation in the rates of clearing across regions, where most protected areas from North America and Europe showed positive rates of land cover change, while protected areas from Asia had the highest rates of land-cover clearing. While most protected areas from North America and Europe involved a relatively smaller number of actors, a greater number of actors and drivers of clearing was implicated in protected areas from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, indicating the increased difficulties faced by park management in these regions. In contrast, country income levels and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources category of protection did not appear to impact the likelihood of land-cover clearing in protected areas.},

abstract = {Monitoring protected areas and their surrounds at local to regional scales is essential given their vulnerability to anthropogenic pressures, including those associated with climatic fluctuation, and important for management and fulfilment of national and international directives and agreements. Whilst monitoring has commonly revolved around field data, remote sensing can play a key role in establishing baselines of the extent and condition of habitats and associated species diversity as well as quantifying losses, degradation or recovery associated with specific events or processes. Landsat images constitute a major data source for habitat monitoring, capturing broad scale information on changes in habitat extent and spatial patterns of fragmentation that allow disturbances in protected areas to be identified. These data are, however, less able to provide information on changes in habitat quality, species distribution and fine-scale disturbances, and hence data from other spaceborne optical sensors are increasingly being considered. Very High Resolution (VHR) optical datasets have been exploited to a lesser extent, partly because of the relative recency of spaceborne observations and challenges associated with obtaining and routinely extracting information from airborne multi-spectral and hyperspectral datasets. The lack of a shortwave infrared band in many VHR datasets and provision of too much detail (e.g., shadows within and from landscape objects) also present challenges in some cases. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, particularly when used synergistically with optical data, have benefited the detection of changes in the three-dimensional structure of habitats. This review shows that remote sensing has a strong, yet underexploited potential to assist in the monitoring of protected areas. However, the data generated need to be utilized more effectively to enable better management of the condition of protected areas and their surrounds, prepare for climate change, and assist planning for future landscape management. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the tropics and sub-tropics, where high levels of biodiversity co-exist with some of the greatest levels of population density, achieving complete exclusion in protected area contexts has proved close to impossible. There is a clear need to recognize that parks are significantly impacted by human-environment interactions in the larger landscape within which they are embedded, and to move the frontier of research beyond the boundaries of protected areas in order to examine larger landscapes where multiple forms of ownership and access are embedded. This research evaluates forest change and fragmentation between 1990 and 2000, in a landscape surrounding the Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary in the Indian state of West Bengal. This protected forest is bounded to the south by a less intensively protected area, the Baikunthapur Reserve Forest, and surrounded by a mosaic of unprotected, largely private land holdings. Results indicate differences in the extent and spatial pattern of forest cover change in these three zones, corresponding to different levels of government protection, access and monitoring. The two protected areas experience a trend toward forest regrowth, relating to the cessation of commercial logging by park management during this period. Yet, there is still substantial clearing toward peripheral areas that are well connected to illegal timber markets by transportation networks. The surrounding landscape, although experiencing some forest regrowth within less intensively cultivated tea plantations, is also becoming increasingly fragmented, with potentially critical impacts on the maintenance of effective wildlife corridors in this ecologically critical region.},

Here, we document and characterize a previously unknown multi-country migration of Burchell's zebra Equus quagga that is the longest of all recorded large mam- mal migrations in Africa. Our data from eight adult female zebras collared on the border of Namibia and Botswana show that in December 2012 all individuals crossed the Chobe River and moved due south to Nxai Pan National Park in Botswana, where they spent a mean duration of 10 weeks before returning, less directly, to their dry season floodplain habitat. The same southward movements were also observed in December 2013. Nxai Pan appeared to have similar environmental conditions to several possible alternative wet season destinations that were closer to the dry season habitat on the Chobe River, and water avail- ability, but not habitat or vegetation biomass,was associated with higher-use areas along the migratory pathway. These results suggest a genetic and/or cultural basis for the choice of migration destination, rather than an environmental one. Regardless of the cause, the round-trip, straight-line mi- gration distance of 500 km is greater than that covered by wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus during their well-known seasonal journey in the Serengeti ecosystem. It merits con- servation attention, given the decline of large-scale ecologi- cal processes such as animal migrations.},

Despite the development of modern statistical methods for analyzing partial migration, there have been no studies on what influences partial migration in tropical environments. We present research on factors affecting partial migration in African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in northeastern Namibia. Our dataset is derived from 32 satellite tracking collars, spans 4 years and contains over 35,000 locations. We used remotely sensed data to quantify various factors that buffalo experience in the dry season when making decisions on whether and how far to migrate, including potential man-made and natural barriers, as well as spatial and temporal heterogeneity in environmental conditions. Using an information-theoretic, non-linear regression approach, our analyses showed that buffalo in this area can be divided into 4 migratory classes: migrants, non-migrants, dispersers, and a new class that we call "expanders". Multimodel inference from least-squares regressions of wet season movements showed that environmental conditions (rainfall, fires, woodland cover, vegetation biomass), distance to the nearest barrier (river, fence, cultivated area) and social factors (age, size of herd at capture) were all important in explaining variation in migratory behaviour. The relative contributions of these variables to partial migration have not previously been assessed for ungulates in the tropics. Understanding the factors driving migratory decisions of wildlife will lead to better-informed conservation and land-use decisions in this area.},

abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.

Over this decade, KNP generally maintained forest cover, tree species, and primate populations, whereas neighboring communal forest patches were reduced by half and showed substantial declines in tree species and primate populations. However, a bad decade for forest outside the park proved a prosperous one for most local residents. Panel data for 252 households show substantial improvement in welfare indicators (e.g., safer water, more durable roof material), with the greatest increases found among those with highest initial assets. A combination of regression analysis and matching estimators shows that although the poor tend to be located on the park perimeter, proximity to the park has no measureable effect on growth of productive assets. The risk for land loss among the poor was inversely correlated with proximity to the park, initial farm size, and decline in adjacent communal forests. We conclude the current disproportionate presence of poor households at the edge of the park does not signal that the park is a poverty trap. Rather, Kibale appears to provide protection against desperation sales and farm loss among those most vulnerable.},

Using matching techniques to control for this bias, this paper analyzes the global tropical forest biome using forest fires as a high resolution proxy for deforestation; disaggregates impacts by remoteness, a proxy for deforestation pressure; and compares strictly protected vs. multiple use PAs vs indigenous areas. Fire activity was overlaid on a 1 km map of tropical forest extent in 2000; land use change was inferred for any point experiencing one or more fires. Sampled points in pre-2000 PAs were matched with randomly selected never-protected points in the same country. Matching criteria included distance to road network, distance to major cities, elevation and slope, and rainfall. In Latin America and Asia, strict PAs substantially reduced fire incidence, but multi-use PAs were even more effective. In Latin America, where there is data on indigenous areas, these areas reduce forest fire incidence by 16 percentage points, over two and a half times as much as na{\"{i}}ve (unmatched) comparison with unprotected areas would suggest. In Africa, more recently established strict PAs appear to be effective, but multi-use tropical forest protected areas yield few sample points, and their impacts are not robustly estimated. These results suggest that forest protection can contribute both to biodiversity conservation and CO2 mitigation goals, with particular relevance to the REDD agenda. Encouragingly, indigenous areas and multi-use protected areas can help to accomplish these goals, suggesting some compatibility between global environmental goals and support for local livelihoods.},

abstract = {Animals that differ in reproductive status and body size have different needs in terms of foraging and resting. In most social ungulates this leads to sexual segregation, probably because of incompatibilities between the activity budgets of males and females. Since most studies on behavioural differences between the sexes have been done on sexually dimorphic species, we decided to look at a system in which males and females are similar in body size. We studied time budgets, synchrony of behaviour, and bite rates of plains zebras (Equus burchelli) to evaluate the factors that enable these extremely social ungulates to stay in stable mixed-sex family groups throughout the year. As we predicted, time budgets were similar among males, lactating females, pregnant females, and non-reproductive females. Furthermore, we observed close synchronization of behaviours between females that differed in reproductive status and males. Lactating females, however, did take more bites per minute when foraging than either pregnant or nonreproducing females or males. We assume that the higher bite rates of lactating females were due to the extra costs of producing milk for their foal. We concluded that the special harem mating system, and for females the year-round possibility of conceiving, force the animals to synchronize their time budgets, which might be a major reason for the lack of difference in body size between males and females.},

abstract = {Animal movement patterns in space and time are a central aspect of animal ecology. Remotely-sensed environmental indices can play a key role in understanding movement patterns by providing contiguous, relatively fine-scale data that link animal movements to their environment. Still, implementation of newly available remotely-sensed data is often delayed in studies of animal movement, calling for a better flow of information to researchers less familiar with remotely-sensed data applications. Here, we reviewed the application of remotely-sensed environmental indices to infer movement patterns of animals in terrestrial systems in studies published between 2002 and 2013. Next, we introduced newly available remotely-sensed products, and discussed their opportunities for animal movement studies. Studies of coarse-scale movement mostly relied on satellite data representing plant phenology or climate and weather. Studies of small-scale movement frequently used land cover data based on Landsat imagery or aerial photographs. Greater documentation of the type and resolution of remotely-sensed products in ecological movement studies would enhance their usefulness. Recent advancements in remote sensing technology improve assessments of temporal dynamics of landscapes and the three-dimensional structures of habitats, enabling near real-time environmental assessment. Online movement databases that now integrate remotely-sensed data facilitate access to remotely-sensed products for movement ecologists. We recommend that animal movement studies incorporate remotely-sensed products that provide time series of environmental response variables. This would facilitate wildlife management and conservation efforts, as well as the predictive ability of movement analyses. Closer collaboration between ecologists and remote sensing experts could considerably alleviate the implementation gap. Ecologists should not expect that indices derived from remotely-sensed data will be directly analogous to field-collected data and need to critically consider which remotely-sensed product is best suited for a given analysis.},

abstract = {The increasing isolation of protected areas poses a serious threat to the long-term viability of many wildlife populations and migrations in Africa. While ecologists have debated the impact of isolation on wildlife populations in reserves, field studies conducted over the past decade now provide a much clearer understanding of the effects. The primary drivers of isolation of protected areas are habitat loss, fences and roads, overhunting, and disease. These drivers restrict the movement of wildlife into and out of reserves and create sinks in the increasingly human-dominated matrix that surrounds most reserves. Post-establishment patterns of extinction of large mammal species in African reserves indicate that area and edge effects are important determinants of species persistence. Interactions and feedbacks between reserve isolation, human-related activities, and natural processes within and outside reserves can occur, yet are poorly understood. The problem of reserve isolation must therefore be addressed...},

abstract = {Smallholder farmers in Laikipia district of Kenya, like their counterparts in water scarce semi-arid environments, are facing the challenge of improving agricultural productivity and livelihoods. A number of viable options are available, but high hydrological risks and low economic capability are discouraging the poor and risk-averse farmers. Rainwater harvesting and management (RHM) is one of the promising options, whose impacts are unfortunately also affected by hydrological risks related to unreliable rainfall. The paper presents a hydro-economic analysis of RHM systems with the aim of analyzing some of the factors that affect their adoption by smallholder farmers. Hydro-economic analysis included hydrological reliability of RHM systems, agro-hydrological risks and economic analysis. Agro-hydrological risk focused on dry spell and drought analysis, which affect soil moisture availability and hence crop production. Hydrological reliability assessed the ability of a RHM system to harvest and store adequate runoff to meet supplemental irrigation requirement to bridge dry spells and mitigate the impacts of persistent droughts. Economic analysis addressed benefit-cost analysis and profitability of RHM in terms of increasing crop production and stabilizing yields. The study was conducted in Kalalu and Matanya, which are in two different agro-climatic zones and represent land-use changes in the recently settled areas of Laikipia district. The results provide a basis for farmers to make informed decisions on agricultural investments under hydrologic risks and uncertain production systems. RHM systems for supplemental irrigation were found to be an economically viable option for improving agricultural production and livelihoods of smallholder farmers in drought prone rural areas. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The first step in conservation planning is to identify objectives. Most stated objectives for conservation, such as to maximize biodiversity outcomes, are too vague to be useful within a decision-making framework. One way to clarify the issue is to define objectives in terms of the risk of extinction for multiple species. Although the assessment of extinction risk for single species is common, few researchers have formulated an objective function that combines the extinction risks of multiple species. We sought to translate the broad goal of maximizing the viability of species into explicit objectives for use in a decision-theoretic approach to conservation planning. We formulated several objective functions based on extinction risk across many species and illustrated the differences between these objectives with simple examples. Each objective function was the mathematical representation of an approach to conservation and emphasized different levels of threat Our objectives included minimizing the joint probability of one or more extinctions, minimizing the expected number of extinctions, and minimizing the increase in risk of extinction from the best-case scenario. With objective functions based on joint probabilities of extinction across species, any correlations in extinction probabilities bad to be known or the resultant decisions were potentially misleading. Additive objectives, such as the expected number of extinctions, did not produce the same anomalies. We demonstrated that the choice of objective function is central to the decision-making process because alternative objective functions can lead to a different ranking of management options. Therefore, decision makers need to think carefully in selecting and defining their conservation goals},

abstract = {Empirical evidence has shown that farmers can adapt to climate change by using sustainable land and water management (SLWM) practices that provide local mitigation benefits, reducing or offsetting the negative effects of climate change at the level of the plot, farm, or even landscape. However, adaptation to climate change using SLWM practices in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains low. This study was conducted to examine the impact of government policies on adaptation to climate change. Kenya and Uganda in East Africa and Niger and Nigeria in West Africa were used as case studies. The selection ensured that the transboundary sites had comparable biophysical and livelihood characteristics and that the major difference between the sites across the border was the policies in each subregion. The study used a variety of data sources including satellite imagery data, focus group discussions, and household- and plot-level survey data to determine how land users have responded to climate change and the impacts of their responses on agricultural productivity, climate-related risks, and carbon stock. Each of the four case study countries offers success stories that enhance adaptation strategies. While Kenya's policies have strongly supported agricultural research and development as well as an agricultural market environment that has offered incentives to farmers to adopt SLWM, neighboring Uganda has implemented government decentralization and a land tenure system, both of which have contributed to the rise of stronger local institutions that offer opportunities for improved community resource management. In West Africa, Nigeria has long supported irrigation development and recently focused on small-scale irrigation that has increased agricultural production and reduced production risks in the drier, northern states. Even though such irrigation programs were not implemented as part of adaptation to climate change, they have helped farmers to adapt well to climate change. Niger also offers a good example of tree planting and protection, which was successful due to the Rural Code, which gave land users rights to own benefit from trees on their farms and thereby contributed to the regreening of the Sahel. Hence, in all the countries we see the influence of policies that have influenced adoption of SLWM and response to climate change in general, policies that show promise for scaling up. Scaling up these success stories requires public investment to raise awareness and provide the technological support required for these often knowledge-intensive practices. The relative success of Kenya in promoting soil conservation and fertility measures suggests that large-scale extension programs can be effective but that they require long-term commitment, something that is absent in the common practice of project funding. The long-term extension project in Kenya was also supported by a large number of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) active in land management. These organizations not only complement an extension program but inject a degree of innovation that can lead to the generation of improved SLWM practices. Facilitating the linkages among all development organizations, and with research organizations, would serve to enhance the scaling up process. Some SLWM practices may require special attention. Specifically, irrigation is touted as an essential ingredient for increased productivity and for climate change adaptation in Africa by numerous organizations, including the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). Irrigation faces many of the same challenges as other SLWM practices but also brings in the element of the need for capital investment (in water storage or distribution) and more effective adaptation to climate change.},

Mapping areas important for animal movement has therefore become a key part of conservation planning. Models of landscape connectivity are often parameterized using expert opinion and seldom distinguish between the risks and barriers presented by different crop types. Recent research, however, suggests different crop types, such as row crops and orchards, differ in the degree to which they facilitate or impede species movements. Like many mammalian carnivores, bobcats (Lynx rufus) are sensitive to fragmentation and loss of connectivity between habitat patches. We investigated how distinguishing between different agricultural land covers might change conclusions about the relative conservation importance of different land uses in a Mediterranean ecosystem. Bobcats moved relatively quickly in row crops but relatively slowly in orchards, at rates similar to those in natural habitats of woodlands and scrub. We found that parameterizing a connectivity model using empirical data on bobcat movements in agricultural lands and other land covers, instead of parameterizing the model using habitat suitability indices based on expert opinion, altered locations of predicted animal movement routes. These results emphasize that differentiating between types of agriculture can alter conservation planning outcomes.},

abstract = {1. Seasonal rivers in semi-arid African savannas support riparian woodland and hydromorphic grassland, key habitats for wildlife or livestock. We investigated the effect of numerous, small., agricultural dams built on low-order streams within the Kolope-Setonki subcatchment of the Limpopo river. We examined how reducing or changing the pattern of water flow in the main rivers will affect the riparian or hydromorphic vegetation. 2. Existing hydrological models demonstrate a mean annual water flow of 7.6 x 10(6) m(3), ranging from zero to 215 x 10(6) m(3). The catchment area affected by agricultural dams increased from 2{\%} to 50{\%} between 1955 and 1987. Dams are believed to have curtailed the flow during years of low flow. 3. The water requirement of four key species was assessed from their elevation above and distance from the river such that Faidherbia albida {\textgreater} Schotia brachypetala similar to Xanthocercis zambesiaca {\textgreater} Combretum imberbe. This order did not accord with the relative degree of mortality and canopy dieback. Twenty-nine per cent of F. albida trees were dead and the remainder had lost an average of 31{\%} of canopy volume; S. brachypetala and X. anzbesiaca exhibited negligible dieback and no mortality; whereas 10{\%} of C imberbe were dead and the remainder had lost an average of 8{\%} of canopy volume. 4. Tree size and water availability influenced mortality and canopy dieback of F. albida and C. imberbe. Mortality of F albida affected trees of all except the smallest size, although dead trees were on average larger than living trees. Dead trees of C imberbe were at a greater elevation above or distance from the river. The likelihood of F albida experiencing dieback was greater at higher elevations above the river and for larger trees, whereas that of C. imberbe was greater at greater distances from and higher elevations above the river if a tree was large. 5. Woody cover on hydromorphic grasslands, mainly of Acacia tortilis, increased from 8{\%} to 37{\%} between 1955 and 1987. Most of the increase occurred between 1965 and 1977, coincident with the extended 1960s drought and the above-average rain-fall of the 1970s in a system that had been exposed to sustained, severe grazing by livestock. 6. The cumulative impact of many small farm dams on downstream rivers is apparently to reduce flow during critical dry years to levels causing dieback of F. albida and C. imberbe and desiccation of hydromorphic grassland. The water requirements of this vegetation need to be determined for policy makers to address the conflicting water needs of agriculture and indigenous vegetation.},

abstract = {Wildlife populations are declining severely in many protected areas and unprotected pastoral areas of Africa. Rapid large-scale land use changes, poaching, climate change, rising population pressures, governance, policy, economic and socio-cultural transformations and competition with livestock all contribute to the declines in abundance. Here we analyze the population dynamics of 15 wildlife and four livestock species monitored using aerial surveys from 1977 to 2011 within Kajiado County of Kenya, with a rapidly expanding human population, settlements, cultivation and other developments. The abundance of the 14 most common wildlife species declined by 67{\%} on average (2{\%} / yr) between 1977 and 2011 in both Eastern (Amboseli Ecosystem) and Western Kajiado. The species that declined the most were buffalo, impala, wildebeest, waterbuck, oryx, hartebeest, Thomson's gazelle and gerenuk in Eastern Kajiado (70{\%} to 88{\%}) and oryx, hartebeest, impala, buffalo, waterbuck, giraffe, eland and gerenuk in Western Kajiado (77{\%} to 99{\%}). Only elephant (115{\%}) and ostrich (216{\%}) numbers increased contemporaneously in Eastern and Western Kajiado, respectively. Cattle and donkey numbers also decreased on average by 78{\%} in Eastern Kajiado and by 37{\%} in Western Kajiado. Sheep and goats decreased the least in Eastern (28{\%}) but increased in Western (96{\%}) Kajiadio. Livestock dominated (70-80{\%}) the total large herbivore biomass throughout the 1977-2011 monitoring period. The distribution of wildlife contracted dramatically during 1977-2011, most especially for wildebeest, giraffe and impala. Only zebra and ostrich distributions expanded in the county. However, livestock distribution expanded to densely cover most of the county. Our findings point to recurrent droughts, intensifying human population pressures, land use changes and other anthropogenic impacts, decades of ineffective or failed government policies, legislations, law enforcement, management institutions and strategies as the salient causes of the declines and range compressions. We recommend several urgent measures to rehabilitate the depleted wildlife populations and habitat richness, restore their ecological resilience to droughts and secure pastoral livelihoods.},

abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are a key strategy for protecting biological resources, but they vary considerably in their effectiveness, and are frequently reported as having negative impacts on local people. This has contributed to a divisive and unresolved debate concerning the compatibility of environmental and socioeconomic development goals. Elucidating the relationship between positive and negative social impacts and conservation outcomes of PAs is key for the development of more effective and socially just conservation. Here, we conduct a global analysis of how PAs affect the wellbeing of local people, the factors associated with these impacts, and crucially the relationship between PAs' conservation and socioeconomic outcomes. Our results show that PAs reporting positive socioeconomic outcomes are more likely to report positive conservation outcomes. We find positive conservation and socioeconomic outcomes are more likely to occur when PAs adopt co-management regimes, empower local people, reduce economic inequalities and maintain cultural and livelihood benefits. While the strictest regimes of PA management attempt to exclude anthropogenic influences to achieve biological conservation objectives, our study provides evidence that PAs that explicitly integrate local people as stakeholders tend to be more effective at achieving joint biological conservation and socioeconomic development outcomes. Strict protection may be needed in some circumstances, yet our results demonstrate that conservation and development objectives can be synergistic and highlight management strategies that increase the probability of achieving win-win scenarios that maximize conservation performance and development outcomes of PAs.

abstract = {Memory is among the most important and neglected forces that shapes animal movement patterns. Research on the movement-memory interface is crucial to understand how animals use spatial learning to navigate across space because memory-biased navigation is directly linked to animals' space use and home range behaviour; however, because memory cannot be measured directly, it is difficult to account for. Here, we incorporated spatial memory into Step Selection Functions (SSF) to understand how resource selection and spatial memory affect space use of feral hogs (Sus scrofa). We used Biased Random Bridge kernel estimates linked to residence time as a surrogate for memory and tested four conceptually different dynamic maps of spatial memory. We applied this memory-based SSF to a data set of hog relocations to evaluate the importance of land cover type, time of day, and spatial memory on the animals' space use. Our approach has shown how the incorporation of spatial memory into animal movement models can improve estimates of habitat selection. Memory-based SSF provided a feasible way to gain insight into how animals use spatial learning to guide their movement decisions. We found that while hogs selected forested areas and water bodies and avoided grasslands during the day (primarily at noon), they had a strong tendency to select previously visited areas, mainly those held in recent memory. Beyond actively updating their memory with recent experiences, hogs were able to discriminate among spatial memories encoded at different circadian phases of their activity. Even though hogs are thought to have long memory retention, they likely relied on recent experiences because the local food resources are quickly depleted and slowly renewed, yielding an uncertain spatial distribution of resources.

abstract = {Determining the scale and pattern of, and the influences on, the movements of Mongolian gazelles is important because their numbers and range have been reduced significantly, and their remaining grassland habitat faces further fragmentation and degradation. Therefore, during 2000-2005 we monitored movements of individually marked Mongolian gazelle calves and adult females in the Eastern Steppe of Mongolia to identify variation in seasonal range sizes and locations, group sizes, and range characteristics. Annual range size for calves varied over an order of magnitude (800-18 700 km
                        2), and none of 9 calves tracked for a full year returned to their birth site. Adult gazelles ranged widely (14 000-32 000 km
                        2 annually) and individuals captured together showed little range overlap. Seasonal shifts in range use suggested gazelles are readily able to take advantage of changing conditions, but the lack of consistent use of seasonal ranges is characteristic of a nomadic movement strategy. Developing strategies that protect ungulate populations that demonstrate nomadic movements is an important consideration in future conservation decisions. Understanding the ecology driving these movements will be an important next step. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Climate change and habitat fragmentation are considered key pressures on biodiversity. In this paper we explore the potential synergetic effects between these factors. We argue that processes at two levels of spatial scale interact: the metapopulation level and the species range level. Current concepts of spatially dynamic metapopulations and species ranges are consistent, and integration improves our understanding of the interaction of landscape level and geographical range level processes. In landscape zones in which the degree of habitat fragmentation allows persistence, the shifting of ranges is inhibited, but not blocked. In areas where the spatial cohesion of the habitat is below the critical level of metapopulation persistence, the expansion of ranges will be blocked. An increased frequency of large-scale disturbances caused by extreme weather events will cause increasing gaps and an overall contraction of the distribution range, particularly in areas with relatively low levels of spatial cohesion. Taking into account the effects of climate change on metapopulations, habitat distribution and land use changes, future biodiversity research and conservation strategies are facing the challenge to re-orient their focus and scope by integrating spatially and conceptually more dynamic aspects at the landscape level. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Knowledge about the spatial distribution of seabirds at sea is important for conservation. During marine conservation planning, logistical constraints preclude seabird surveys covering the complete area of interest and spatial distribution of seabirds is frequently inferred from predictive statistical models. Increasingly complex models are available to relate the distribution and abundance of pelagic seabirds to environmental variables, but a comparison of their usefulness for delineating protected areas for seabirds is lacking. Here we compare the performance of five modelling techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, Random Forest, boosted regression trees, and maximum entropy) to predict the distribution of Balearic Shearwaters (. Puffinus mauretanicus) along the coast of the western Iberian Peninsula. We used ship transect data from 2004 to 2009 and 13 environmental variables to predict occurrence and density, and evaluated predictive performance of all models using spatially segregated test data. Predicted distribution varied among the different models, although predictive performance varied little. An ensemble prediction that combined results from all five techniques was robust and confirmed the existence of marine important bird areas for Balearic Shearwaters in Portugal and Spain. Our predictions suggested additional areas that would be of high priority for conservation and could be proposed as protected areas. Abundance data were extremely difficult to predict, and none of five modelling techniques provided a reliable prediction of spatial patterns. We advocate the use of ensemble modelling that combines the output of several methods to predict the spatial distribution of seabirds, and use these predictions to target separate surveys assessing the abundance of seabirds in areas of regular use. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This thesis deals with the dynamics of large herbivores in the Masai Mara ecosystem in Kenya. The study area is famous for the annual migration of wildebeest and common zebra from and back to the Serengeti in Tanzania. In this study we made a distinction between these two migratory species and the other non-migratory wildlife species. The results reported are based on animal population estimates derived from counts made on board of small light aircraft. The study covers the period from 1977 to 1997. The total of non-migratory wildlife species in the Masai Mara ecosystem declined by 58{\%} in the last 20 years. The decline ranged from 49{\%} in small brown antelopes to 72{\%} in medium brown antelopes. In individual species, the decline ranged from 52{\%} in Grant's gazelle to 88{\%} in the warthog. The population sizes of the elephant, impala and ostrich remained constant during the analysis period. There was no significant difference in the decline of wildlife inside and outside the Masai Mara National Reserve except for Thomson's gazelle and warthog. The population sizes of all livestock species except for the donkey did not significantly change during the entire analysis period. A large proportion of wildebeest migrates between the Serengeti and the Masai Mara ecosystem. A smaller population migrates between the Masai Mara National Reserve and the Loita plains in the north. Statistical analysis revealed that the size of this so-called "resident" wildebeest population declined by 81{\%} over the last 20 years. Further analysis revealed a remarkable association between the decline in resident wildebeest population and the expansion of wheat farming into prime and original wildebeest habitat in the Loita plains. We therefore conclude that loss of former wildlife habitat to agriculture was responsible for the drastic decline of this resident wildebeest population. Apart from habitat loss to agriculture, droughts, poaching and possibly competition between wildlife and livestock may have further contributed to the decline. We argue that these factors and agricultural encroachment may have been responsible for the reported decline of the non-migratory species as well. In the last chapter of this thesis we studied a number of environmental factors that could be associated to the migration of wildebeest and common zebra. We found a significant relationship between wet season rainfall in Kenya and the size of the wildebeest and zebra population migrating into the Masai Mara ecosystem. We also found a significant relationship between dry season NDVI and the size of wildebeest population migrating into the Masai Mara ecosystem. We concluded that wet season rainfall and availability of food in the dry season influence the migration into the Masai Mara ecosystem. We also concluded that NDVI could be used for monitoring and predicting the movements of migratory wildebeest populations in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem. In this thesis we report an alarming decline of most wildlife populations in Masai Mara ecosystem over the past 20 years. Furthermore, we made it plausible that this decline was related to habitat loss, due to agricultural encroachment. Socio-economic surveys not analyzed in this thesis but reported elsewhere, indicated that the local people in the areas adjoining the Masai Mara national Reserve anticipate that they will put their hands to the plough once land adjudication process will be completed. The impact of this would be a further decline and possibly a complete collapse of the wildlife populations for which the Masai Mara is reputed. Therefore, it is extremely urgent that a balance be struck between wildlife conservation and this alternative land-use if the current downward wildlife population trend is to be reversed. Lastly the current Kenyan legislation prohibits on one hand the killing of wildlife, while on the other hand leaving the option open for unlimited destruction of its habitat. The reported decline of the resident wildebeest population is in our view is a direct result of this gap in the legislation. We argue that it is urgent to reconsider the wildlife conservation policy and adjust its legislation such that it would be possible to protect wildlife habitat outside the protected area system from further undesirable destruction.},

abstract = {In many tropical countries forest fragmentation caused by changes in human land use activities is of primary concern for sustainability. In Malaysia this relationship is usually described without any quantitative measurement to show the implications for land use planning and management. To understand this relationship, this study developed a single forest fragmentation index based on a combination of three landscape metrics, i.e., non-forest area, forest edge bordered by human land use and patch size coefficient of variation, using the state of Selangor, Malaysia as a case study. Two defined natural landscapes; wetland and forest landscapes were used as a basic unit of analyses of pattern change of forest fragmentation and its relationship to human land use in three temporal years of 1966, 1981 and 1995. Results showed that forest fragmentation in the state of Selangor generally increased during the time periods studied. Multiple regression analysis showed that human land use is an important determinant of forest fragmentation, but the significance of several land uses as explanatory variables to forest fragmentation changed temporally. Oil palm and rubber plantations were apparently the major contributors to forest fragmentation. Differences in fragmentation pattern occurred between the two natural landscapes. Forest fragmentation increased in the wetland landscape, whereas not much change was observed in the forest landscape. Oil palm plantation appeared to be the major contributor to forest fragmentation in the wetland landscape, whereas rubber plantation was the major factor in the forest landscape. This study also revealed that knowledge of forest fragmentation through a single index in different natural landscapes provides a pathway for identifying which forested areas are highly threatened and must be given priority in strategic planning of nature conservation. In conclusion, it is vital to understand the relationship between changes in human land use and degree of forest degradation measured by a single index in order to describe the implications for land use planning and management.},

abstract = {* The loss, fragmentation and degradation of habitat everywhere on Earth prompts increasing attention to identifying landscape features that support animal movement (corridors) or impedes it (barriers). Most algorithms used to predict corridors assume that animals move through preferred habitat either optimally (e.g. least cost path) or as random walkers (e.g. current models), but neither extreme is realistic. * We propose that corridors and barriers are two sides of the same coin and that animals experience landscapes as spatiotemporally dynamic corridor-barrier continua connecting (separating) functional areas where individuals fulfil specific ecological processes. Based on this conceptual framework, we propose a novel methodological approach that uses high-resolution individual-based movement data to predict corridor-barrier continua with increased realism. * Our approach consists of two innovations. First, we use step selection functions (SSF) to predict friction maps quantifying corridor-barrier continua for tactical steps between consecutive locations. Secondly, we introduce to movement ecology the randomized shortest path algorithm (RSP) which operates on friction maps to predict the corridor-barrier continuum for strategic movements between functional areas. By modulating the parameter Ѳ, which controls the trade-off between exploration and optimal exploitation of the environment, RSP bridges the gap between algorithms assuming optimal movements (when Ѳ approaches infinity, RSP is equivalent to LCP) or random walk (when Ѳ → 0, RSP → current models). * Using this approach, we identify migration corridors for GPS-monitored wild reindeer (Rangifer t. tarandus) in Norway. We demonstrate that reindeer movement is best predicted by an intermediate value of Ѳ, indicative of a movement trade-off between optimization and exploration. Model calibration allows identification of a corridor-barrier continuum that closely fits empirical data and demonstrates that RSP outperforms models that assume either optimality or random walk. * The proposed approach models the multiscale cognitive maps by which animals likely navigate real landscapes and generalizes the most common algorithms for identifying corridors. Because suboptimal, but non-random, movement strategies are likely widespread, our approach has the potential to predict more realistic corridor-barrier continua for a wide range of species.},

Therefore, measuring habitat availability at biologically relevant scales is essential for understanding preference, but herein lies a trade-off: Models fitted at large spatial scales, will tend to average across the responses of different individuals that happen to be in regions with contrasting habitat compositions.

abstract = {Landscapes consisting of heterogeneous environmental conditions (e.g. elevational gradients) are richer in species diversity than more homogeneous landscapes. Furthermore, the importance of heterogeneous landscapes has been widely acknowledged in biodiversity conservation due to expected elevational shifts in ranges as a result of climate change. This is especially important in mountainous landscapes. There is as yet no protocol that conservation planners can use to integrate landscape heterogeneity in the design of protected area (PAs) systems. In this study, we tested whether Nepal, as a whole, consists of highly heterogeneous landscapes in term of elevation, and whether heterogeneity of PAs is correlated with their size and species diversity. We developed a conservation index of elevational zones within Nepal to evaluate their representativeness in the protected area system. The results showed that, in Nepal's PAs, indices of elevational heterogeneity were strongly associated with species richness. However, heterogeneity indices were not strongly associated with sizes of PAs despite the fact that Nepal is a highly heterogeneous country. The same is true for national parks and conservation areas based on IUCN-The World Conservation Union's categories of PAs. The conservation index of elevation zones suggested a bias in reserve selection towards higher elevations. There is an urgent need to rectify past biases in reserve design so as to ensure protection of elevational heterogeneity during conservation planning, especially in these times of human-induced climate change.},

Consideration of operational and environmental factors emphasise the benefits of the cattlepost system, while socio-economic and political factors explain why the current drive towards fenced ranches will continue for the foreseeable future. It is concluded that while the degradation issue on Botswana's rangelands has been overstated, alleged concern for the conservation of the grazing resource is explicitly driving Botswana's current New Agricultural Policy. By accentu- ating the existing marked socio-economic inequalities within the livestock sector, such misplaced policies will fuel much graver environmental prob- lems, as the underlying equity issue remains unaddressed.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: This review highlights the latest developments associated with the use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ecology. Over the last decade, the NDVI has proven extremely useful in predicting herbivore and non-herbivore distribution, abundance and life history traits in space and time. Due to the continuous nature of NDVI since mid-1981, the relative importance of different temporal and spatial lags on population performance can be assessed, widening our understanding of population dynamics. Previously thought to be most useful in temperate environments, the utility of this satellite-derived index has been demonstrated even in sparsely vegetated areas. Climate models can be used to reconstruct historical patterns in vegetation dynamics in addition to anticipating the effects of future environmental change on biodiversity. NDVI has thus been established as a crucial tool for assessing past and future population and biodiversity consequences of change in climate, vegetation phenology and primary productivity.},

abstract = {Assessing how environmental changes affect the distribution and dynamics of vegetation and animal populations is becoming increasingly important for terrestrial ecologists to enable better predictions of the effects of global warming, biodiversity reduction or habitat degradation. The ability to predict ecological responses has often been hampered by our rather limited understanding of trophic interactions. Indeed, it has proven difficult to discern direct and indirect effects of environmental change on animal populations owing to limited information about vegetation at large temporal and spatial scales. The rapidly increasing use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ecological studies has recently changed this situation. Here, we review the use of the NDVI in recent ecological studies and outline its possible key role in future research of environmental change in an ecosystem context. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim Earth observation (EO) products are a valuable alternative to spectral veg- etation indices.We discuss the availability of EO products for analysing patterns in macroecology, particularly related to vegetation, on a range of spatial and temporal scales. Location Global. Methods We discuss four groups of EO products: land cover/cover change, veg- etation structure and ecosystem productivity, fire detection, and digital elevation models. We address important practical issues arising from their use, such as assumptions underlying product generation, product accuracy and product trans- ferability between spatial scales. We investigate the potential of EO products for analysing terrestrial ecosystems. Results Land cover, productivity and fire products are generated from long-term data using standardized algorithms to improve reliability in detecting change of land surfaces. Their global coverage renders them useful for macroecology. Their spatial resolution (e.g. GLOBCOVER vegetation, 300 m; MODIS vegetation and fire, ?500 m; ASTER digital elevation, 30 m) can be a limiting factor. Canopy structure and productivity products are based on physical approaches and thus are independent of biome-specific calibrations. Active fire locations are provided in near-real time, while burnt area products show actual area burnt by fire. EO products can be assimilated into ecosystem models, and their validation informa- tion can be employed to calculate uncertainties during subsequent modelling. Main conclusions Owing to their global coverage and long-termcontinuity, EO end products can significantly advance the field of macroecology. EO products allow analyses of spatial biodiversity, seasonal dynamics of biomass and produc- tivity, and consequences of disturbances on regional to global scales. Remaining drawbacks include inter-operability between products from different sensors and accuracy issues due to differences between assumptions and models underlying the generation of differentEOproducts.Our review explains the nature of EOproducts and how they relate to particular ecological variables across scales to encourage their wider use in ecological applications.

abstract = {Illegal poaching threatens wildlife across Africa. Historically and even today, conservationists have lobbied local and national governments to create and better manage protected lands to reduce this threat. In many cases, however, governments are either unable or unwilling to invest further resources in exclusive protected areas, such as national parks. In addition to traditional methods, or where such approaches are not feasible, a complimentary form of protection is researcher presence, which has been described recently to deter wildlife poaching. We present data over four years that assesses the impact of researcher presence on wildlife and snare encounter rate in an unprotected area in western Tanzania, where there is a mid-term chimpanzee study ongoing. We systematically collected spatiotemporal presence data on the nine, most common mammal species in the study area, as well as all snares. Snare encounter rates increased with distance from researcher base station, whilst overall mammal encounter rates decreased. Further, mammal encounter rates have increased each year since the arrival and permanence of researchers in this remote area. Our findings have implications for the benefits of researcher presence, namely in deterring poaching, especially in unprotected areas with minimal governmental surveillance.},

The AVHRR instruments have flown or are flying on fourteen polar-orbiting meteorological satellites operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and are currently flying on two European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) polar-orbiting meteorological satellites, MetOp-A and MetOp-B. This long AVHRR record is comprised of data from two different sensors: the AVHRR/2 instrument that spans July 1981 to November 2000 and the AVHRR/3 instrument that continues these measurements from November 2000 to the present. The main difficulty in processing AVHRR NDVI data is to properly deal with limitations of the AVHRR instruments. Complicating among-instrument AVHRR inter-calibration of channels one and two is the dual gain introduced in late 2000 on the AVHRR/3 instruments for both these channels. We have processed NDVI data derived from the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) from 1997 to 2010 to overcome among-instrument AVHRR calibration difficulties. We use Bayesian methods with high quality well-calibrated SeaWiFS NDVI data for deriving AVHRR NDVI calibration parameters. Evaluation of the uncertainties of our resulting NDVI values gives an error of ± 0.005 NDVI units for our 1981 to present data set that is independent of time within our AVHRR NDVI continuum and has resulted in a non-stationary climate data set.},

The social rank of an equid mare is typically correlated with her age. Further, high-ranking captive plains zebra mares produce more surviving offspring than low-ranking mares. The objectives of this study were to, first, examined the factors that influence social rank of captive plains zebra mares, and second, test if high-ranking mares conceive earlier and if they have shorter inter-birth intervals than low-ranking ones. We observed three herds of captive plains zebra (a total of 18 mares) at the Dv??r Kr??lov?? Zoo, Czech Republic. During the 831 h of observation, we recorded 1713 aggressive interactions (biting and offensive kicking) between the mares. These data were used to determine, for each mare, the total number of mares that dominated her in each period of social stability. The GLMM model revealed that older mares were dominated by a lower number of mares than the younger mares. We also found that the probability that a mare would conceive declined with the increasing number of dominant mares. Further, we tested the relationship between the number of dominant mares and the inter-birth interval using 29 intervals for 15 mares. These inter-birth intervals were divided into two groups. When a stallion was continuously present in the herd, the intervals lasted from one birth to the next birth (natural intervals). When a herd was without a stallion, the intervals lasted from the release of the stallion into the herd to the birth of foal (stallion-influenced intervals). The analysis revealed that the inter-birth intervals decreased with an increasing number of dominant mares and the natural intervals decreased with an increasing number of offspring successfully reared by a mare. This finding is the first one in equids and contributes to the previous findings that suggest that social status influences reproductive success. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We assess the potential for future biodiversity loss due to three interacting factors: energy withdrawal from ecosystems due to biomass harvest, habitat loss due to land-use change, and climate change. We develop four scenarios to 2050 with different combinations of high or low agricultural efficiency and high or low meat diets, and use species-energy and species-area relationships to estimate their effects on biodiversity. In our scenarios, natural ecosystems are protected except when additional land is necessary to fulfil the increasing dietary demands of the global population. Biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is used as a means of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere (and offsetting fossil fuel emissions). BECCS is based on waste biomass, with the addition of bio-energy crops only when already managed land is no longer needed for food production. Forecast biodiversity loss from natural biomes increases by more than a factor of five in going from high to low agricultural efficiency scenarios, due to destruction of productive habitats by the expansion of pasture. Biodiversity loss from energy withdrawal on managed land varies by a factor of two across the scenarios. Biodiversity loss due to climate change varies only modestly across the scenarios. Climate change is lowest in the 'low meat high efficiency' scenario, in which by 2050 around 660 million hectares of pasture are converted to biomass plantation that is used for BECCS. However, the resulting withdrawal of energy from managed ecosystems has a large negative impact on biodiversity. Although the effects of energy withdrawal and climate change on biodiversity cannot be directly compared, this suggests that using bio-energy to tackle climate change in order to limit biodiversity loss could instead have the opposite effect.},

abstract = {1.Roads are a prevalent, ever-increasing form of human disturbance on the landscape. In many places in western North America, energy development has brought human and road disturbance into seasonal winter range areas for migratory elk. 2.We sought to evaluate predictions from the risk-disturbance hypothesis when studying elk response to roads during winter. Road proximity and crossing were used to evaluate these behaviours, which offered a rare comparison between two common measures of roads. We used integrated Step Selection Analysis (iSSA) to evaluate four alternative hypotheses regarding the influence of roads on space–use behaviour across 175 elk-years of elk telemetry data, and we quantified both population and individual variation in responses. 3.We demonstrated, for the first time, how iSSA can be used to combine movement analysis in a refined approach to habitat selection. Elk responded to roads as they would natural predation risk. Elk selected areas farther from roads at all times of day with avoidance being greatest during twilight. In addition, elk sought cover and moved more when in the vicinity of roads. Road crossings were generally avoided, but this avoidance was weakest during daytime when elk were both moving and closer to roads. 4.Synthesis and applications. Energy development is transforming landscapes in western North America with the proliferation of roads, which we show is having substantial and multifaceted negative effects on elk movement and behaviour. These adverse effects can be mitigated by minimizing new road construction and by restricting traffic on roads as well as providing protection of tree cover on elk winter ranges.},

abstract = {Better management and knowledge regarding the effect of land use intensification on mammal abundance and occupancy is crucial for species conservation. This is particularly true in dynamic forest-farmland mosaics subjected to rapid human-induced habitat alterations for agricultural practices. We conducted camera-trap surveys at 44 locations across farmland use gradients between October 2012 and January 2013. We estimated occupancy and relative abundance of 10 terrestrial mammals in response to farmland use in the Drakensberg Midlands, South Africa. Occupancy modelling revealed the importance of available forest and wetland to several mammals. Occupancy estimates for Leptailurus serval were lower in cropland than for Herpestes ichneumon, Atilax paludinosus and Potamochoerus larvatus. Occupancy of Leptailurus serval and Redunca rundinu increased with relative human abundance while the relationship was inverse for Hystrix cristata and Potamochoerus larvatus. Livestock-related activity influenced occupancy of Potamochoerus larvatus positively and Hystrix cristata negatively. Pesticide usage had a negative impact on detection of several mammals, and occupancy of Atilax paludinosus. Commercial plantation influenced occupancy of Tragelaphus scriptus and Potamochoerus larvatus positively. Plantation supported the abundance of five species positively. Wetland influenced relative abundance of Leptailurus serval positively. Pesticide use significantly decreased relative abundance of Leptailurus serval and Atilax paludinosus. Livestock and human relative abundance were positively associated with relative abundance of Leptailurus serval and Canis mesomelas and negatively for other species. Our models proved the sensitivity of some mammals towards the natural habitat loss due to agricultural practices while others appeared to be tolerant to such human-modified habitats. We suggest feasible management implications for conserving diverse mammalian assemblages in farmland mosaics.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The analysis of landscape change impacts on community composition and dynamics is difficult for species rich plant communities, because of their high complexity. One approach to deal with this challenge are generic process-based models. In these models, the species are described by a common set of parameters and functional responses. Thus, they allow both the integration of knowledge on key processes, and a common description for several ecological patterns. An important aspect of these models are trade-offs in the species' physiological and life-history traits, which prevent ‘super-species' that dominate under all environmental con- ditions. We compare process-based models with two other model types that have been applied to similar ends – statis- tical habitat models, and phenomenological population models. These process-based models come at the price of an increased number of parameters for an individual species. However, a description of the interactions between species, which has proven difficult to incorporate in statistical habitat models, or requiring excessively many parameters in phenomenological population models, can be included easily. Finally, processed-based models produce a rich set of patterns on several organizational levels that can be compared to empirical obser- vations, and thus be used for model calibration and validation. The approach is illustrated with a case study of Southern African plant communities. The investigated semi-arid landscapes are characterized by high stochastic fluctuations in population sizes. These fluctuations may in the short term mask the effects of environmental or land use change, and models allow to assess likely long-term consequences. Questions pertinent to the management of these landscapes include the effect of grazing on the diversity of the plant communities and the impact of climate change},

abstract = {Landscape position, grazing, and seasonal variation in precipitation and temperature create spatial and temporal variability in soil processes, and plant biomass and composition in grasslands. However, it is unclear how this variation in plant and soil properties affects carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes. The aim of this study is to explore the effect of grazing, topographic position, and seasonal variation in soil moisture and temperature on plant assimilation, shoot and soil respiration, and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). Carbon dioxide fluxes, vegetation, and environmental variables were measured once a month inside and outside long-term ungulate exclosures in hilltop (dry) to slope bottom (mesic) grassland throughout the 2004 growing season in Yellowstone National Park. There was no difference in vegetation properties and CO2 fluxes between the grazed and the ungrazed sites. The spatial and temporal variability in CO2 fluxes were related to differences in aboveground biomass and total shoot nitrogen content, which were both related to variability in soil moisture. All sites were CO2 sinks (NEE{\textgreater}0) for all our measurements taken throughout the growing season; but CO2 fluxes were four- to fivefold higher at sites supporting the most aboveground biomass located at slope bottoms, compared to the sites with low biomass located at hilltops or slopes. The dry sites assimilated more CO2 per gram aboveground biomass and stored proportionally more of the gross-assimilated CO2 in the soil, compared to wet sites. These results indicate large spatio-temporal variability of CO2 fluxes and suggest factors that control the variability in Yellowstone National Park.},

abstract = {Invasive plants are thought to be especially capable of range shifts or expansion in response to climate change due to high dispersal and colonization abilities. Although highly invasive throughout the Intermountain West, the presence and impact of the grass Bromus tectorum has been limited at higher elevations in the eastern Sierra Nevada, potentially due to extreme wintertime conditions. However, climate models project an upward elevational shift of climate regimes in the Sierra Nevada that could favor B. tectorum expansion. This research specifically examined the effects of experimental snow depth manipulations and interannual climate variability over 5 years on B. tectorum populations at high elevation (2,175 m). Experimentally-increased snow depth had an effect on phenology and biomass, but no effect on individual fecundity. Instead an experimentally-increased snowpack inhibited population growth in 1 year by reducing seedling emergence and early survival. A similar negative effect of increased snow was observed 2 years later. However, a strong negative effect on B. tectorum was also associated with a naturally low-snow winter, when seedling emergence was reduced by 86{\%}. Across 5 years, winters with greater snow cover and a slower accumulation of degree-days coincided with higher B. tectorum seedling density and population growth. Thus, we observed negative effects associated with both experimentally-increased and naturally-decreased snowpacks. It is likely that the effect of snow at high elevation is nonlinear and differs from lower elevations where wintertime germination can be favorable. Additionally, we observed a doubling of population size in 1 year, which is alarming at this elevation.},

abstract = {The Okavango catchment is a hot spot of accelerating land use change. In particular, climate predictions, demographic developments and a growing utilization of ecosystem services and functions are expected to increase pressure on resources and land. Land use conflicts, the sustenance of precarious livelihoods, deforestation of woodland savannahs, upstream-downstream water issues and human-wildlife conflicts are among the processes that are characteristic of policy and management challenges in the region. In the Eastern and Western Kavango regions of Namibia and the Cuando-Cubango province of Angola, a unique cross-border situation exists that allows assessing how the combination of local traditions, regional land management and national policies determines spatial patterns of land use and land cover transformation processes.To map major land use types and change processes we used a set of multi-temporal Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ data sets, support vector machine (SVM) classification and iterative spectral mixture analysis (ISMA) on images covering the period from 1990 to 2010. Integrating satellite imagery with literature reviews, interviews, census and household survey data, we assessed the contrasting development of resource utilization on both sides of the Okavango River. We investigated if and how policies and regulations at different levels drive land use decisions, and how these decisions manifest spatially.We found a strong and interconnected urban growth on both sides of the river. The area around Rundu has constantly been evolving to become Namibia's second largest city, also functioning as a hub of development and transborder commerce with opposing Calai. This trend was found to affect adjacent settlement areas and cause widespread conversion of woodland savannahs to agricultural land or their utilization for timber extraction. The conversion of woodland savannah to arable land was by far the dominant land use change process on both sides of the river, with a total conversion area of 460km2 (Namibia) and 293km2 (Angola) observed during the observation period. Strong spatial change gradients occurred in relation to determining factors, such as accessibility, proximity to water, urban centres, etc., while relations to settlements where less obvious. Assessing results by country illustrated the difference in land use intensity and resource consumption between Angola and Namibia, which relate directly to historical developments, with a long period of stability in Namibia standing opposed to the recent and ongoing recovery from civil war in Angola. These are added to by statutory and traditional policy frameworks, the national endowment with natural capital (e.g. oil, uranium, diamonds, zinc) and the integration into global markets, which strongly affects national economies of both countries at large.Underlying land use decisions were found to be largely driven by individualized perspectives on growth ideologies, consumerism and wealth-aspirations connected to globalization processes. However, at present the result of these perspectives is still mainly a small-structured conversion to rainfed agriculture as a component of subsistence strategies of local livelihoods, and thus stands opposed to other regions of the world, where change processes are much more driven by large companies or follow national regulations and result in more intensive uses.},

The global protected-area network has grown substantially in recent decades, now occupying 11.5{\{}{\%}{\}} of Earth's land surface, but such growth has not been strategically aimed at maximizing the coverage of global biodiversity. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the global network is far from complete, even for the representation of terrestrial vertebrate species. Here we present a first attempt to provide a global framework for the next step of strategically expanding the network to cover mammals, amphibians, freshwater turtles and tortoises, and globally threatened birds. We identify unprotected areas of the world that have remarkably high conservation value (irreplaceability) and are under serious threat. These areas concentrate overwhelmingly in tropical and subtropical moist forests, particularly on tropical mountains and islands. The expansion of the global protected-area network in these regions is urgently needed to prevent the loss of unique biodiversity},

abstract = {Ongoing loss of biodiversity requires identifying large-scale conservation priorities, but the detailed information on the distribution of species required for this purpose is often missing. We present a systematic reserve selection for 1223 African mammals and amphibians in which habitat suitability models are used as estimates of the area occupied by species. In the framework of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Global Amphibian Assessment and IUCN Global Mammal Assessment, we collected the geographic range (extent of occurrence) and habitat preferences for each species. We used the latter to build species-specific habitat suitability models inside geographic ranges, and for 181 species we verified the models by comparing suitability levels to presence-absence data collected in the field. We then used the suitable areas as estimators of the area of occupancy and compared the results of systematic reserve selection based on geographic ranges to those based on estimated areas of occupancy. Our results showed that the reserve system would need a 30-100{\%} expansion to achieve minimal conservation targets, concentrated in the tropics, where species richness reaches a maximum. Comparative analyses revealed that using geographic ranges, which overestimate the area occupied by species, underestimates the total amount of area that needs to be conserved. The area selected for conservation doubled when we used the estimated area of occupancy in place of the geographic ranges. This happened because the suitable areas potentially occupied by each species overlapped less than their geographic ranges. As a result, any given protected area contained fewer species than predicted by the analysis of ranges. Because species are more specialized than our estimates of distribution based on extent of occurrence suggest, we propose that this is a general effect in systematic conservation planning.},

Our goals were to increase conservation practitioners' use of remote sensing to support their work, increase collaboration between the conservation science and remote sensing communities, identify and develop new and innovative uses of remote sensing for advancing conservation science, provide guidance to space agencies on how future satellite missions can support conservation science, and generate support from the public and private sector in the use of remote sensing data to address the 10 conservation questions. We identified a broad initial list of questions on the basis of an email chain-referral survey. We then used a workshop-based iterative and collaborative approach to whittle the list down to these final questions (which represent 10 major themes in conservation): How can global Earth observation data be used to model species distributions and abundances? How can remote sensing improve the understanding of animal movements? How can remotely sensed ecosystem variables be used to understand, monitor, and predict ecosystem response and resilience to multiple stressors? How can remote sensing be used to monitor the effects of climate on ecosystems? How can near real-time ecosystem monitoring catalyze threat reduction, governance and regulation compliance, and resource management decisions? How can remote sensing inform configuration of protected area networks at spatial extents relevant to populations of target species and ecosystem services? How can remote sensing-derived products be used to value and monitor changes in ecosystem services? How can remote sensing be used to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation efforts? How does the expansion and intensification of agriculture and aquaculture alter ecosystems and the services they provide? How can remote sensing be used to determine the degree to which ecosystems are being disturbed or degraded and the effects of these changes on species and ecosystem functions?},

Here, we review highlights from the third international conference on biologging science, which was held in California, USA, from 1 to 5 September 2008. Over the last few years, considerable progress has been made with a range of recording technologies as well as with the management, visualization, integration and analysis of increasingly large and complex biologging datasets. Researchers use these techniques to study animal biology with an unprecedented level of detail and across the full range of ecological scales—from the split-second decision making of individuals to the long-term dynamics of populations, and even entire communities.

abstract = {We used more than 10 years of data on buffalo herds in a Geographic Information System (GIS) of Klaserie Private Nature Reserve (KPNR) to examine ranging behavior and habitat selection at multiple temporal and geographic scales. We compared 3 methods of empirical home range estimation: minimum convex polygons (MCP); a fixed-kernel method; and a new local nearest-neighbor convex-hull construction method (LoCoH). For 3 herds over 5 years (1995–2000), the southern herd (SH) had the largest range, the focal study herd (FH) had the intermediate range, and the northern herd (NH) had the smallest range. The LoCoH method best-described the ranges because it accommodated user knowledge of known physical barriers, such as fences, whereas the MCP and kernel methods overestimated ranges. Short-term ranges of the FH over 9 years reveal that buffalo travel farther and range wider in the dry season than the wet. Habitat selection analyses on broad vegetation categories showed preference for Acacia shrub veld and Combretum-dominated woodlands. We found no significant selection of habitat at a fine geographic and temporal interval using the remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), but the index was correlated to ranging behavior at a larger geographic scale. We found that buffalo selected areas within 1 km of water sources, and an isopleth analysis using the new LoCoH method showed preference for riverine areas in both seasons. This suggests that buffalo preferentially select for areas near water, but they may range farther in the dry season for higher-quality food. As KPNR has a higher density of water than the neighboring Kruger National Park (KNP), this study provides a comparison of buffalo response to water availability in a smaller reserve and important information to managing the buffalo population as part of the larger Greater Kruger Management Area (GKMA).

abstract = {As habitat loss and fragmentation increase across ungulate ranges, identifying and prioritizing migration routes for conservation has taken on new urgency. Here we present a general framework using the Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) that: (1) provides a probabilistic estimate of the migration routes of a sampled population, (2) distinguishes between route segments that function as stopover sites vs. those used primarily as movement corridors, and (3) prioritizes routes for conservation based upon the proportion of the sampled population that uses them. We applied this approach to a migratory mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) population in a pristine area of southwest Wyoming, USA, where 2000 gas wells and 1609 km of pipelines and roads have been proposed for development. Our analysis clearly delineated where migration routes occurred relative to proposed development and provided guidance for on-the-ground conservation efforts. Mule deer migration routes were characterized by a series of stopover sites where deer spent most of their time, connected by movement corridors through which deer moved quickly. Our findings suggest management strategies that differentiate between stopover sites and movement corridors may be warranted. Because some migration routes were used by more mule deer than others, proportional level of use may provide a reasonable metric by which routes can be prioritized for conservation. The methods we outline should be applicable to a wide range of species that inhabit regions where migration routes are threatened or poorly understood.},

abstract = {Aerial surveys from 1970 onwards suggest a stable Kafue lechwe population of 94 000±9{\%} on the Kafue Flats. The present distribution shows a contraction in dry and wet season range in comparison with 1953/54. Sex ratios of populations on both the North and South banks of the Kafue river do not differ significantly from unity. North bank males have a higher survival rate than South bank males. Survival curves for males and females on the South bank show the same pattern. For both the 1971 and 1972 breeding seasons 73{\%} of South bank females older than 1½ years are expected to have bred successfully. The peaks of conceptions for both seasons are from mid-December to mid-March, suggesting a main lambing period from mid-July until mid-October. Present sex ratio, age structure, reproductive status and the reproductive cycle have been compared with 1961/62 data. Variation in physical condition, based on monthly measurements of the kidney fat percentage, dressing-out percentage and live weight, although influenced by the physiological demands of rut and pregnancy, is correlated with the availability of flood-plain grazing. The lowest values of condition parameters are found during the period of maximum flood, after the end of the rains (April/May), until the receding flood makes flood-plain grazing available, usually in early June. A high level of tuberculosis, lungworm infection and many other pathogens amongst the South bank population are reported. Animals from the North bank are thought to be in better physical condition. The Kafue Gorge dam, completed in 1971, and the Iteshi-teshi dam, at present under construction, will prolong the high flood period in wet years and prevent most flooding in dry years, both of these effects will reduce the carrying capacity of the flood plain for lechwe and a large reduction of the size of the population is expected to result from the operation of the dams.},

The zebras had organized themselves in harem groups. Stallions appeared to spend more time acting socially than did other sex-age classes and they spent less time feeding. Social behaviours were mainly directed against other stallions. Stallions were also more on the alert. The time-budget of safari park zebras largely agrees with that of their wild counterparts. From data on time budgets and from differences in the reproductive output of adults of different ranks it is concluded that differential access to food plays an important role in the safari park. ?? 1987.},

Results show that regular forest burning procures valuable forest products like fuel wood and fodder grass, mainly serving domestic purposes. We discuss the tradeoffs that would result from an alteration of the existing fire scenario with respect to FDES, the likely impact on local economies, and possible management options.

abstract = {Abstract. The spatial resolution of Landsat imagery has proven to be well suited for the analysis of vegetation patterns and dynamics at regional scale; however, the low temporal frequency is often a limitation for the quantification of vegetation dynamics. The spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) combines moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) and Landsat thematic mapper/enhanced thematic mapper plus (TM/ETM+) imagery to a high spatiotemporal resolution dataset. A time series of 333 STARFM images was generated between February 2000 and September 2007 (8-day interval) at Landsat spatial and spectral resolution for a 12×10 km heterogeneous test area within the North Queensland Savannas. Time series of observed Landsat and predicted STARFM images correlated high for each spectral band (0.89 to 0.99). The STARFM algorithm was tested in a regionalization study where sudden change events were analyzed for a pallustrine wetland. A MODIS subpixel analysis showed a very close relationship between STARFM normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and MODIS NDVI data (root mean square error of 0.027). A phenological description of the major vegetation classes within the region revealed distinct differences and lag times within the ecosystem. The 2004 dry season NDVI minimum-map correlated highly with the validated 2004 foliage projective cover product (r2=0.92) from the Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management.},

abstract = {The Kalahari sand sheet occupies 2.5 million ha in southern Africa. It is an area with relatively similar deep aeolian soils, and a strong south to north gradient in rainfall, from 200 to 1000 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP) in the region studied. This provides an excellent basis for gradient studies at the subcontinental scale. This paper briefly reviews the literature on the vegetation of the Kalahari and describes the vegetation structure and composition at 11 new sites. There is a clear gradient in woody plant biomass (as indexed by basal area) from south to north. Above the minimum level of 200 mm MAP, the woody basal area increases at a rate of ca. 2.5 m2.ha-1 per 100 mm MAP. Mean maximum tree height also increases along the gradient, reaching 20 m at ca. 800 mm MAP. The number of species to contribute {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 95{\{}{\%}{\}} of the woody basal area increases from one at 200 mm to 16 at 1000 mm MAP. Members of the Mimosaceae (mainly Acacia) dominate the tree layer up to 400 mm MAP. They are replaced by either the Combretaceae (Combretum or Terminalia) or Colophospermum mopane of the Caesalpinaceae between 400 and 600 mm MAP, and by other representatives of the Caesalpinaceae above 600 mm MAP. The vegetation is largely deciduous up to 1000 mm MAP, except for species that apparently have access to groundwater, which may be locally dominant above about 600 mm MAP},

In part because of this complexity, universally applicable measures of biodiversity have proven elusive. Commonly used measures, such as the number of species present, are strongly scale-dependent and only reveal a change after species have been lost. Indices incorporating several proxy signals are potentially sensitive, but their arbitrariness obscures underlying trends and mechanisms.

abstract = {The sensitivity of Earth's wetlands to observed shifts in global precipitation and temperature patterns and their ability to produce large quantities of methane gas are key global change questions. We present a microwave satellite-based approach for mapping fractional surface water (FW) globally at 25-km resolution. The approach employs a land cover-supported, atmospherically-corrected dynamic mixture model applied to 20+ years (1992–2013) of combined, daily, passive/active microwave remote sensing data. The resulting product, known as Surface WAter Microwave Product Series (SWAMPS), shows strong microwave sensitivity to sub-grid scale open water and inundated wetlands comprising open plant canopies. SWAMPS' FW compares favorably (R2 = 91{\%}–94{\%}) with higher-resolution, global-scale maps of open water from MODIS and SRTM-MOD44W. Correspondence of SWAMPS with open water and wetland products from satellite SAR in Alaska and the Amazon deteriorates when exposed wetlands or inundated forests captured by the SAR products were added to the open water fraction reflecting SWAMPS' inability to detect water underneath the soil surface or beneath closed forest canopies. Except for a brief period of drying during the first 4 years of observation, the inundation extent for the global domain excluding the coast was largely stable. Regionally, inundation in North America is advancing while inundation is on the retreat in Tropical Africa and North Eurasia. SWAMPS provides a consistent and long-term global record of daily FW dynamics, with documented accuracies suitable for hydrologic assessment and global change-related investigations.},

In this study, a landscape-level ecological model was modified to this end. We describe the structure and evaluation of the fire sub-model of the new landscape model LandClim, which was designed to simulate climate–fire–vegetation dynamics. We applied the model to an extended elevational gradient in the Colorado Front Range to test its ability to simulate vegetation composition and the strongly varying fire regime along the gradient. The simulated sequence of forest types along the gradient corresponded to the one observed, and the location of ecotones lay within the range of observed values. The model captured the range of observed fire rotations and reproduced realistic fire size distributions. Although the results are subject to considerable uncertainty, we conclude that LandClim can be used to explore the relative differences of fire regimes between strongly different climatic conditions.},

Understanding where animals forage is important for the conservation of multi-species communities, since interspecific competition can emerge if different species use the same depletable resources. However, determining forage resources in a spatially continuous fashion in alpine grasslands at high spatial resolution was challenging up to now, because terrain heterogeneity causes vegetation characteristics to vary at small spatial scales, and methods for detection of behavioural phases in animal movement patterns were not widely available. We delineated areas coupled to the foraging behaviour of three sympatric ungulate species (chamois, ibex, red deer) using Time Local Convex Hull (T-LoCoH), a non-parametric utilisation distribution method incorporating spatial and temporal autocorrelation structure of GPS data. We used resource maps of plant biomass and plant nitrogen content derived from high-resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy data, and multinomial logistic regression to compare the foraging areas of the three ungulate species.},

abstract = {This study attempts to identify how much understanding of the driving forces of land-use changes can be gained through a spatial, statistical analysis. Hereto, spatial, statistical models of the proximate causes of different processes of land-use change in the Mara Ecosystem (Kenya) were developed, taking into account the spatial variability of the land-use change processes. The descriptive spatial models developed here suggest some important factors driving the land-use changes that can be related to some well-established theoretical frameworks. The explanatory variables of the spatial model of mechanised agriculture suggest a von Th{\"{u}}nen-like model, where conversion to agriculture is controlled by the distance to the market, as a proxy for transportation costs, and agro-climatic potential. Expansion of smallholder agriculture and settlements is also controlled by land rent, defined, in this case, by proximity to permanent water, land suitability, location near a tourism market, and vicinity to villages to gain access to social services (e.g. health clinics, schools, local markets). This difference in perception of land rent reflects the widely different social and economic activities and objectives of smallholders versus the large entrepreneurs involved in mechanised farming. Spatial heterogeneity as well as the variability in time of land-use change processes affect our ability to use regression models for wide ranging extrapolations. The models allow evaluating the impact of changes in driving forces that are well represented by proximate causes of land-use change. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Roads can act as barriers to animal movement through mortality during crossing attempts or behavioral avoidance. This barrier effect has negative demographic and genetic consequences that can ultimately result in local or regional extinction. Here we use radio-telemetry data on three terrestrial vertebrates (eastern massasauga Sistrurus catenatus, eastern box turtle Terrapene carolina and ornate box turtle Terrapene ornata) to test whether roads acted as barriers to movement. Specifically, we test whether individuals avoided crossing roads by comparing the number of observed crossings with the number of road crossings predicted by randomizations of individual movement paths. All species crossed roads significantly less often than predicted by chance, indicating strong road avoidance. Results of this study showing behavioral avoidance and previous studies on road mortality indicate that roads are strong barriers to these species. High mortality during crossing attempts would select for road avoidance, reducing the number of individuals killed on roads over time but leading to genetically partitioned subpopulations due to a lack of gene flow. In species that are long-lived and late-maturing, negative genetic effects might not be observable over short time-scales, thus placing populations at high risk of extinction because of a failure to detect an incrementally worsening problem. Formulating successful management strategies for many species in decline will require integrating data on road mortality, animal behavior and population genetics in order to understand more clearly the barrier effect of roads.},

abstract = {Adaptive management and related fields have theorized new governance strategies that embrace complexity and are able to respond effectively to changing and unpredictable biophysical dynamics. However, this body of work pays inadequate attention to important on-the-ground realities, including feasibility of implementation and the power dynamics embedded in multi-scalar systems of environmental governance. This paper presents findings from a research project on challenges to adaptive management in the variable wetland ecosystem of the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Many residents of this rural region rely on transitional agricultural practices, shifting between dryland and floodplain farming in response to dynamic precipitation and flooding patterns. Higher than average floods in 2009???2011 inundated many floodplain fields past the point of production, causing farmers to shift to the dryland for multiplem seasons. At the same time, the highly centralized Government of Botswana began to implement stricter regulations over floodplain resources, which stemmed in part from a new adaptive management plan developed for the region. As a result, many farmers felt pressured by the government to abandon transitional livelihood practices and to shift permanently to dryland agriculture even though many preferred to continue floodplain farming. This loss of a responsive livelihood strategy will likely result in decreased long-term adaptive capacity for many residents. Drawing on these findings, this paper advances the argument that if adaptive management is to become a viable option for communities in changing environments, more attention must be given to the role of unequal power relations in multi-scalar systems of environmental governance.},

abstract = {Land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) is the main cause of the global biodiversity crisis and protected areas are critical to prevent habitat loss. Rapid changes in institutional and socio-economic conditions, such as the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, often trigger widespread LULCC. Yet, it is unclear how effective protected areas are in safeguarding habitat within them during such periods of rapid LULCC. Our goal here was to map changes in forest cover and agricultural lands from 1984 to 2010 in order to assess the effectiveness of two strictly protected areas, Oksky and Mordovsky State Nature Reserves, in temperate European Russia. We analyzed dense time series of Landsat images for three Landsat footprints and applied a support vector machine classification and trajectory-based change detection to map forest disturbance. We then used matching statistics to quantify the effectiveness of the protected areas. Our analyses highlighted considerable post-Soviet LULCC in European Russia. The LULCC maps revealed disturbances on 5.02{\%} of the total forest area, with strongly declining disturbance rates in post-Soviet times. We also found that 39.89{\%} of the agricultural land used in 1988 was abandoned after 1991, leading to widespread forest regrowth. Oksky and Mordovsky State Nature Reserves had a significantly lower probability of forest disturbance (-0.1 to -3.5{\%} lower) in comparison to their surrounding areas. This suggests that protected areas were relatively effective in limiting human-induced forest disturbance in European Russia, despite lower levels of control and an eroding infrastructure for nature protection. Moreover, we found drastic land-cover changes, particularly forest regrowth, in the surroundings of these protected areas, highlighting conservation opportunities. Protected areas can play a key role in biodiversity conservation during periods of rapid LULCC, and remote sensing coupled with matching statistics provide important tools for monitoring the success and failure of conservation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Data from long-term ecological studies further understanding of ecosystem dynamics and can guide evidence-based management. In a quasi-natural experiment we examined long-term monitoring data on different components of the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem to trace the effects of disturbances and thus to elucidate cause-and-effect connections between them. The long-term data illustrated the role of food limitation in population regulation in mammals, particularly in migratory wildebeest and nonmigratory buffalo. Predation limited populations of smaller resident ungulates and small carnivores. Abiotic events, such as droughts and floods, created disturbances that affected survivorship of ungulates and birds. Such disturbances showed feedbacks between biotic and abiotic realms. Interactions between elephants and their food allowed savanna and grassland communities to co-occur. With increased woodland vegetation, predators' capture of prey increased. Anthropogenic disturbances had direct (hunting) and indirect (transfer of disease to wildlife) effects. Slow and rapid changes and multiple ecosystem states became apparent only over several decades and involved events at different spatial scales. Conservation efforts should accommodate both infrequent and unpredictable events and long-term trends. Management should plan on the time scale of those events and should not aim to maintain the status quo. Systems can be self-regulating through food availability and predator-prey interactions; thus, culling may not be required. Ecosystems can occur in multiple states; thus, there may be no a priori need to maintain one natural state. Finally, conservation efforts outside protected areas must distinguish between natural change and direct human-induced change. Protected areas can act as ecological baselines in which human-induced change is kept to a minimum.},

abstract = {1 Although habitat loss and fragmentation are assumed to threaten the regional survival of plant species, their effects on regional species dynamics via seed dispersal and colonization have rarely been quantified. 2 We assessed the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on the connectivity, and hence regional survival, of wind-dispersed plant species of nutrient-poor semi-natural grasslands. We did this using a new approach to relate quantified habitat loss and fragmentation to quantified colonization capacity. 3 We quantified loss and fragmentation during the 20th century of moist, nutrient-poor semi-natural grasslands in study areas in the Netherlands, as well as their current distribution. After testing how well the habitat distribution matches species distributions of two wind-dispersed grassland forbs (Cirsium dissectum, representative of species with long-distance wind dispersal, and Succisa pratensis, representative of species with short-distance wind dispersal), we combined the habitat distribution data with simulated seed dispersal kernels in order to quantify the impact on connectivity. 4 Habitat loss and fragmentation has dramatically reduced both the area (by 99.8{\%}) and the connectivity of the grasslands. The remaining grasslands are practically isolated for seeds dispersed by wind, even for species with high wind dispersal ability (for which, interestingly, connectivity by wind dispersal decreased most). Linear landscape elements hardly contribute to connectivity by wind dispersal. Regional survival of the studied species has become completely dependent on the survival of a few large populations in nature reserves. Other remaining populations are decreasing in number and size and have low colonization capacity. 5 Habitat loss and fragmentation have drastically changed the regional species dynamics of wind-dispersed plant species, indicating that it is of utmost importance to preserve remaining populations in nature reserves and that the probability of colonization of new or restored sites is very low, unless the sites are adjacent to occupied sites or dispersal is artificially assisted.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPA) are one management tool that can potentially reduce declining shark populations. Protected-area design should be based on detailed movements of target animals; however, such data are lacking for most species. To address this, 25 sharks from three species were tagged with acoustic transmitters and monitored with a network of 103 receivers to determine the use of a protected area at Mangrove Bay, Western Australia. Movements of a subset of 12 individuals (Carcharhinus melanopterus [n=7]), C. amblyrhynchos [n=2], and Negaprion acutidens [n=3]) were analysed over two years. Residency for all species ranged between 12 and 96{\{}{\%}{\}}. Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos had {\{}{\textless}{\}}1{\{}{\%}{\}} of position estimates within the MPA, compared to C. melanopterus adults that ranged between 0 and 99{\{}{\%}{\}}. Juvenile sharks had high percentages of position estimates in the MPA (84–99{\{}{\%}{\}}). Kernel density activity centres for C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos were largely outside the MPA and mean activity space estimates for adults were 12.8 km2 (±3.12 SE) and 19.6 km2 (±2.26), respectively. Juveniles had smaller activity spaces: C. melanopterus, 7.2 ±1.33 km2; N. acutidens, 0.6 km2 (±0.04). Both C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos had peaks in detections during daylight hours (1200 and 0900 h, respectively), whereas N. acutidens had a peak in detections at 0200 h. Long-distance movements were observed for adult C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos, the longest being approximately 275 km. These migrations of C. melanopterus might be related to reproductive behaviours, because they were all observed in adult females during the summer months and provide links between known in-shore aggregation and possible nursery areas. The MPA at Mangrove Bay provided some protection for juvenile and adult reef sharks, although protection is likely greater for juveniles due to their more restricted movements.},

abstract = {The analysis and evaluation of ecosystems in the Okavango region must include a thorough analysis of the fire regime. This requires a full understanding of its components such as fire frequency, fire season and fire intensity. For the Okavango region these components were derived based on an extensive multi-scale compilation of the MODIS products “Active Fire” (AF) and “Burned Area” (BA) covering the period 2001 to 2012. The integrated analysis of these mutually exclusive datasets allowed for a comprehensive characterisation of important descriptors of the large scale fire regime. The descriptive fire parameters are discussed considering dominant land cover classes. These were derived by clustering phenological metrics which were in turn derived by analysing temporally dense MODIS time series of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI).The variation within the study area regarding the overall area affected by fire, the fire frequency as well as the fire seasonality can be explained to a high degree by land cover and local human fire management practises. Thus, Miombo woodlands are less affected by fires than other vegetation communities like for instance thornbush savannahs or grasslands in the river valleys of the upper catchment.We provide a considerable overview of spatial and temporal fire dynamics within the Okavango region. This is an important step in generating the necessary information required to feed into land use management scenarios.},

Opuntia stricta (var stricta), is one of the world's most invasive plants but evidence for the invasion process is limited to historical reconstruction and experiments. Here, we present data on the landscape spread of O.stricta into a high altitude dry savanna on the Laikipia Plateau of Kenya. Factors like species characteristics, ecosystem dynamics, habitat susceptibility, and system context are implicated. We propose that the current invasion, 50 years after the plant arrived in the area, is not the result of a "lag" phenomenon but instead is a response to recent changes in land use primarily sedentarization of pastoralists. Subsequent continuous heavy livestock grazing produced an ecological state transition to degraded rangeland which created the opportunity for the invasion. Thereafter, the special characteristics of O. stricta, the number of mammalian consumers, and additional anthropogenic changes fueled the process. These data strengthen existing evidence that change in land use provides opportunities for alien plant invasions. This Kenyan case illustrates the challenges posed by humanization of ecosystems and suggests why it is important to look at the underlying causes of alien plant invasions, not just deal with the symptoms.},

For the endangered Grevy?s zebra (Equus grevyi), as with many widely ranging vertebrates, human activities may be an important factor affecting space use. Grevy?s zebras are grazing ungulates inhabiting the savannahs of central-northern Kenya and Ethiopia. Past research on their social organization indicates that reproductive status shapes associations and movements. Here, we examine how habitat use varies across four reproductive classes: lactating and nonlactating females, bachelors and territorial males. We also test whether Grevy?s zebra avoid locations close to active livestock corrals, or bomas. We find that forage quality, forage quantity and habitat openness of locations used by Grevy?s zebra vary significantly depending on individual reproductive state. Lactating females and bachelors use areas with green, short grass and medium-dense bush more frequently than nonlactating females or territorial males. We hypothesize that lactating females trade off forage quantity and safety to access nutrients in growing grass. Across reproductive classes, Grevy?s zebra choose locations further from active bomas than if they used the area randomly. Our results suggest that Grevy?s zebra may require a range of vegetation characteristics for different reproductive classes. Further, they may need areas free from competition or disturbance by livestock.; Bien caract{\'{e}}riser le choix de l?habitat est essentiel pour la conservation des esp{\`{e}}ces en danger.

We use network metrics to compare populations of Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi) and onagers (Equus hemionus khur). These closely related equids, previously described as having the same social system, inhabit environments differing in the distribution of food, water, and predators. Grevy's zebra and onagers are one example of many sets of coarsely similar fission-fusion species and populations, observed elsewhere in other ungulates, primates, and cetaceans. Our analysis of the population association networks reveals contrasts consistent with their distinctive environments. Grevy's zebra individuals are more selective in their association choices. Grevy's zebra form stable cliques, while onager associations are more fluid. We find evidence that females associate assortatively by reproductive state in Grevy's zebra but not in onagers. The current approach demonstrates the utility of network metrics for identifying fine-grained variation among individuals and populations in association patterns. From our analysis, we can make testable predictions about behavioral mechanisms underlying social structure and its effects on transmission processes.},

abstract = {In traditional models for social organization, female movements and association patterns track resource distribution, whereas males track females. More recently, this model has been expanded to include feedback effects of male behavior, especially sexual harassment, on female decisions. In Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi), males defend territories containing resources attractive to females, who form unstable groups. Past research has explained female behavior based on resource distribution and needs alone. Lactating females have been found to have restricted movements and fewer male associates than nonlactating females, a pattern we find in our study. This pattern has previously been attributed solely to the higher water needs of lactation. However, in our population, both lactating and nonlactating females are typically close to water. We test the hypothesis that male harassment also influences female ranging and associations with males. This effect is predicted to be greater for lactating females because harassment has higher costs to them. We find that lactating females experience higher harassment rates than those of nonlactating females. Lactating females tend to move faster during harassment periods, whereas nonlactating individuals do not. Lactating females experience lower harassment rates if they spend more time with a particular male, whereas nonlactating females' harassment rates do not depend on their allocation of time to a primary male. We suggest that females concentrate their time with one male in order to reduce male harassment. Even in species such as Grevy's zebra without strong male-female bonds, social interactions may be a significant driver of female distribution. ¬{\textcopyright} The Author 2007.

abstract = {Forest and woodland cover and change were calculated for the Zanzibar-Inhambane biogeographical region of Tanzania and Kenya from 1990 to 2000. A cover and change map was derived from high-resolution satellite imagery from Landsat and supplemental data from aerial overflights, field surveys, and local knowledge. Analyses showed that around 6820 km2 of coastal forest habitat remained in 2000 (2260 km2 in Kenya and 4560 km2 in Tanzania). In terms of change, a total of 424 km2 (6{\%}) of forest was cleared between 1990 and 2000; 53 km2 in Kenya and 371 km2 in Tanzania. Rates of forest loss were 8 times higher in unprotected areas than in protected sites such as Forest Reserves and National Parks. Key Biodiversity Areas had forest loss rates 2.5 times faster than protected areas while Alliance for Zero Extinction sites had the slowest rates of forest loss for the region. These baseline forest cover and change estimates along with future updates can contribute to national and sub-national carbon emission baselines and assessments of species threat within the global Red List.},

Within a single species, populations may be completely migratory, completely sedentary or partially migratory. We use a population model to derive conditions for migration and demonstrate how migratory survival, habitat quality and density dependence on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds influence conditions for migration and the proportion of migrants within a population. Density dependence during the season in which migratory and sedentary individuals use separate sites is necessary for partial migration. High levels of density dependence at the non-shared sites widen the range of survival values within which we predict partial migration, whereas increasing the strength of density dependence at the shared sites narrows the range of survival values within which we predict partial migration. Our results have important implications for predicting how contemporary populations with variable migration strategies may respond to changes in the quality or quantity of habitat.},

We examined how resource availability, spatial scale of resource variability and body size affect migration distance among populations. Resource availability measured as normalised difference vegetation index had a strong negative effect, predicting a tenfold difference in migration distances between low- and high-resource areas and explaining 23{\%} of the variation in migration distances. We found a weak, positive effect of the spatial scale of resource variability but no effect of body size. Resource-poor environments are known to increase the size of mammalian home ranges and territories. Here, we demonstrate that for migratory populations as well, animals living in resource-poor environments travel farther to fulfil their resource needs.},

We investigated this issue by examining the annual movements of the migratory wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, in the 25000 km2 Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem of Tanzania and Kenya. We used Global Positioning System telemetry to track eight wildebeest during 1999–2000 in relation to protected area status in different parts of the ecosystem. The collared wildebeest spent 90{\%} of their time within well-protected core areas. However, two sections of the wildebeest migration route – the Ikoma Open Area and the Mara Group Ranches – currently receive limited protection and are threatened by poaching or agriculture. Comparison of current wildebeest migration routes to those recorded during 1971–73 indicates that the western buffer zones appear to be used more extensively than in the past. This tentative conclusion has important repercussions for management and needs further study. The current development of community-run Wildlife Management Areas as additional buffer zones around the Serengeti represents an important step in the conservation of this UNESCO World Heritage Site. This study demonstrates that detailed knowledge of movement of migratory species is required to plan effective conservation action.},

abstract = {Forest dynamics in New Zealand are shaped by catastrophic, landscape-level disturbances (e.g. volcanic eruptions, windstorms and fires). The long return-intervals of these disturbances, combined with the longevity of many of New Zealand's tree species, restrict empirical investigations of forest dynamics. In combination with empirical data (e.g. palaeoecological reconstructions), simulation modelling provides a way to address these limitations and to unravel complex ecological interactions. Here we adapt the forest landscape model LandClim to simulate dynamics across the large spatio-temporal scales relevant for New Zealand's forests. Using the western slope of Mt Hauhungatahi in the central North Island as a case study, we examine forest succession following the Taupo eruption (c. 1700 cal. years BP), and the subsequent emergence of elevational species zonation. Focusing on maximum growth rate and shade tolerance we used a pattern-oriented parameterisation approach to derive a set of life-history parameters that agree with those described in the ecological literature. With this parameter set, LandClim was able to reproduce similar spatio-temporal patterns in vegetation structure to those seen in pollen reconstructions and contemporary vegetation studies. The modelled successional sequence displayed a major shift in forest composition between simulation years 400 to 700, when the dense initial stands of conifers (dominated mainly by Libocedrus bidwillii) were progressively replaced by the angiosperm Weinmannia racemosa in the montane forest. From around year 1000, the contemporary elevational species zonation was attained. Competition for light controlled the major successional trends and, together with temperature-limitation, explained the observed elevational species zonation. Although originally designed for European temperate forests, LandClim can simulate New Zealand landscape dynamics and forest response to catastrophic disturbances such as the Taupo eruption. We suggest that LandClim provides a suitable framework for investigating the role of spatial processes, in particular disturbance, in New Zealand's forest landscapes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {1. Many organisms undertake migrations between foraging and breeding habitats and while it is assumed that reproductive timing affects fitness, little is known about the degree of individual consistency, and about the causes and consequences of individual variation in migratory timing in organisms other than birds. Here, we report on a 6-year mark–recapture study, including 2048 individuals, of breeding migration in anadromous pike (Esox lucius), an iteroparous top-predatory fish that displays homing behaviour. By repeated sampling across years at a breeding site, we first quantify individual variation both within and between breeding events and then investigate phenotypic correlates and fitness consequences of arrival timing to the breeding site. Our data demonstrate that males arrive before females, that large males arrive later than small males, that the timing of breeding migration varies among years and that individuals are consistent in their timing across years relative to other individuals in the population. Furthermore, data on return rates indicate that arrival time is under stabilizing viability selection, and that individuals who are more flexible in their timing of arrival during the first reproductive years survive longer compared with less flexible individuals. Finally, longitudinal data demonstrate that individuals consistently fine-tune their arrival timing across years, showing that the timing of arrival to breeding sites is influenced by experience. These findings represent rare evidence of how between- and within-individual variations in migratory timing across breeding events are correlated with phenotypic and fitness traits in an ecologically important keystone species. Our results emphasize the importance of considering variation in migratory timing both between and within individuals in studies investigating the fitness consequences of migratory behaviour and have implications for future management.},

abstract = {Background and aims The Coastal Forests of Eastern Africa, stretching along the Indian Ocean coastline from Somalia to Mozambique, are considered by Conservation International to be a global biodiversity hotspot an area of high diversity and endemism under increasing threat. Although the largest remaining extent of these forests is reported to be found in Mozambique, very little is known on their extent, condition and composition here. In addition, the term coastal forest has been used in different ways by different authors. This paper defines and characterises coastal dry forests found in northern Mozambique and assesses their present extent, botanical composition, conservation importance and the threats to these forests. Methods The study area of 18,150 km2 lies in Cabo Delgado Province in north-east Mozambique, adjacent to Tanzania. Its limits are determined primarily by geological substrate and landform. Four smaller study sites were chosen covering a range of landforms. Manual interpretation of satellite imagery dating from 19992002 was used to calculate possible previous and present extent of dense vegetation. Extensive field collecting was used in determining botanical composition and distribution patterns. IUCN Red List assessments were carried out on selected species using distributional criteria. Results Dry forests similar to those in southern Tanzania are found widely scattered across coastal Cabo Delgado, sitting in a matrix of miombo woodland and other vegetation types. However, forest cover is not as extensive was believed. We calculate that the original extent of dense vegetation cover, which includes coastal dry forest, was 6087 km2 which perhaps only 400 km2 . Owing to clearance over the last 150 years this is now only 1182 km2 is moderately-intact dry forest. , of In this southern part of their range such forests are essentially dry, not moist and mesic, and dominated by a high proportion of deciduous or sclerophyllous evergreen trees. The plant species composition differs significantly from that of the surrounding woodlands. There is a marked change in species composition between forest patches along the coast, and they contain numerous species with restricted global distribution. Since 2003, 68 species new to Mozambique have been recorded from Cabo Delgado in addition to 36 possible new species. Many new records are of species previously only known from south-eastern Tanzania. Previously recorded patterns of restricted distribution and high species turnover between forest patches in Kenya and Tanzania are confirmed. Seven coastal forest species were assessed as Endangered. Regional context and conservation Coastal dry forests are discussed in relation to the more widespread sand forests of the continental interior of south-central Africa, and shown to have similarities in ecology, species composition, soils and ecology. Very little of the present extent of coastal forests in Mozambique lies within protected areas. The threats to their continued existence in the face of exploitation for timber, agriculture and oil exploration are outlined.},

abstract = {Spatial data on soils, land use, and topography, combined with knowledge of conservation effectiveness, can be used to identify alternatives to reduce nutrient discharge from small (hydrologic unit code [HUC]12) watersheds. Databases comprising soil attributes, agricultural land use, and light detection and ranging-derived elevation models were developed for two glaciated midwestern HUC12 watersheds: Iowa's Beaver Creek watershed has an older dissected landscape, and Lime Creek in Illinois is young and less dissected. Subsurface drainage is common in both watersheds. We identified locations for conservation practices, including in-field practices (grassed waterways), edge-of-field practices (nutrient-removal wetlands, saturated buffers), and drainage-water management, by applying terrain analyses, geographic criteria, and cross-classifications to field- and watershed-scale geographic data. Cover crops were randomly distributed to fields without geographic prioritization. A set of alternative planning scenarios was developed to represent a variety of extents of implementation among these practices. The scenarios were assessed for nutrient reduction potential using a spreadsheet approach to calculate the average nutrient-removal efficiency required among the practices included in each scenario to achieve a 40{\%} NO-N reduction. Results were evaluated in the context of the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy, which reviewed nutrient-removal efficiencies of practices and established the 40{\%} NO-N reduction as Iowa's target for Gulf of Mexico hypoxia mitigation by agriculture. In both test watersheds, planning scenarios that could potentially achieve the targeted NO-N reduction but remove {\textless}5{\%} of cropland from production were identified. Cover crops and nutrient removal wetlands were common to these scenarios.

abstract = {Mid-winter movements of up to several hundreds of kilometres are typical for many migratory bird species wintering in Africa. Unpredictable temporary food concentrations are thought to result in random movements of such birds, whereas resightings and recoveries of marked birds suggest some degree of site fidelity. Only detailed (e.g. satellite) tracking of individual migrants can reveal the relative importance and the causes of site choice flexibility and fidelity. The present study investigates how mid-winter movements of a Palaearctic-African migratory raptor, Montagu's harrier Circus pygargus, in the Sahel of West Africa are related to the availability of food resources. Thirty harriers breeding or hatched in northern Europe were satellite tracked (2005-2009). On average, four home ranges, each separated by c. 200 km, were visited during one overwinter stay in the Sahel. Wintering home ranges were similar in size to breeding season home ranges (average over wintering and breeding home range size c. 200 km(2) ), and harriers showed high site fidelity between years. Most preferred habitat types in the Sahel were mosaics of grass- and cropland, indicating similar habitat preferences in both the breeding- and wintering seasons. The main prey of Montagu's harriers in the Sahel were grasshoppers Acrididae. Highest grasshopper numbers in the field occurred at relatively low vegetation greenness [normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values 0.17-0.27]. We used NDVI as a proxy of food availability for harriers. During their overwinter stay, Montagu's harriers moved in a South-South-western direction between consecutive home ranges. The birds selected areas within the range of NDVI values associated with high grasshopper numbers, thus tracking a 'green belt' of predictable changes in highest grasshopper availability. Contrary to earlier hypotheses of random movements in the Sahelian-wintering quarters, the present study shows that Montagu's harriers visited distinct home ranges, they were site-faithful and tracked seasonal changes in food availability related to previous rainfall patterns, caused by the shifting Intertropical Convergence Zone. Itinerancy may be the rule rather than an exception among insectivorous birds wintering in African savannahs.},

Research demonstrates that vulnerability is registered not by exposure to hazards (perturbations and stresses) alone but also resides in the sensitivity and resilience of the system experiencing such hazards.

However, advances in the spatial and spectral resolutions of sensors now available to ecologists are making the direct remote sensing of certain aspects of biodiversity increasingly feasible; for example, distinguishing species assemblages or even identifying species of individual trees. In cases where direct detection of individual organisms or assemblages is still beyond our grasp, indirect approaches offer valuable information about diversity patterns. Such approaches derive meaningful environmental parameters from biophysical characteristics that are revealed by remote sensing.},

abstract = {The rural population of semi-arid lands in Kenya face multiple challenges that result from population growth, poor markets, land use and climatic changes. In particular, subsistence oriented farmers face various risks and opportunities in their attempt to secure their livelihoods. This paper presents an analysis on how livelihood assets and strategies of smallholders in Laikipia County, Kenya, have changed within the last decade and discusses the implications for development interventions. The analysis is based on bi-temporal data from 170 semi-structured household interviews in 1997 and a follow-up survey of 30 households conducted in 2010. Well-being indicators were developed and livelihood portfolios compared. The results show a striking persistence in low asset endowment for the majority of smallholders from an aggregated perspective, whereas transitions into and out of better livelihood conditions become evident from a household perspective. The investment in, and accumulation of, conventional buffer or productive assets, such as grain stocks, livestock or land, does not shield households from adverse shocks and stresses as smallholders were shown to easily slip back into poverty. Household portfolios display particular constraints for smallholders in expanding natural resource related activities and a substantial decrease in livestock numbers. While off-farm activities could possibly increase well-being, the prevailing low income levels and high insecurity for the majority who are engaged in off-farm employment, limits the ability to increase livelihood assets in the area. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {To date, the processing of wildlife location data has relied on a diversity of software and file formats. Data management and the following spatial and statistical analyses were undertaken in multiple steps, involving many time-consuming importing/exporting phases. Recent technological advancements in tracking systems have made large, continuous, high-frequency datasets of wildlife behavioural data available, such as those derived from the global positioning system (GPS) and other animal-attached sensor devices. These data can be further complemented by a wide range of other information about the animals' environment. Management of these large and diverse datasets for modelling animal behaviour and ecology can prove challenging, slowing down analysis and increasing the probability of mistakes in data handling. We address these issues by critically evaluating the requirements for good management of GPS data for wildlife biology. We highlight that dedicated data management tools and expertise are needed. We explore current research in wildlife data management. We suggest a general direction of development, based on a modular software architecture with a spatial database at its core, where interoperability, data model design and integration with remote-sensing data sources play an important role in successful GPS data handling.},

abstract = {Abstract There is a need for up-to-date assessments and maps of soil properties and land health at scales relevant for decision-making and management, including for properties that are dynamic and hence change in response to management. Also, there is a need for approaches to soil mapping that capture the ever increasing effects that humans are having on the environment in general and specifically on soil properties worldwide. In this paper, we develop models for digital soil mapping based on remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) platform for Africa. The article presents maps of soil organic carbon (SOC), pH, sand and sum of exchangeable bases, as well as prevalence of root-depth restrictions in the upper 50 cm of the soil profile. Prediction models were developed based on spatially balanced field survey data, representing all major climate zones on the continent. The prediction models for soil property mapping performed well, with overall RMSEP values of 10.6, 0.34, 9.1, and 6.5 for SOC, pH, sand, and sum of bases, respectively. The accuracy of the prediction model for root-depth restrictions was 77{\{}{\%}{\}}, with an AUC of 0.85 and Cohen's kappa value of 0.52 when averaged across predictions run on independent test data. The methods and maps developed can provide much improved identification of soil and land health constraints, and spatial targeting of land management interventions at various scales, informing both policy and practice.},

abstract = {Crop residues (CR) have become a limited resource in mixed crop-livestock farms. As a result of the increasing demand and low availability of alternative resources, CR became an essential resource for household activities, especially for livestock keeping; a major livelihood element of smallholder farmers in the developing world. Farmers' decisions on CR use are determined by farmers' preferences, total crop production, availability of alternative resources and demand for CR. Interaction of these determinants can result in pressures and trade-offs of CR use. Determinants, pressures and trade-offs are shaped by the specific socio-economic and agro-ecological context of these mixed farms. The objective of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of the determinants of CR use and to examine some options to cope with pressures and trade-offs in 12 study sites across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Drawing on socio-economic data at household and village level, we describe how cereal intensification and livestock feed demand influence use, pressures and trade-offs of CR use across study sites, specifically cereal residue. Our results show that in low cereal production and livestock feed demand sites, despite a low demand for CR and availability of alternative biomass, pressures and trade-offs of CR use are common particularly in the dry season. In sites with moderate cereal production, and low-moderate and moderate livestock feed demand, alternative biomass resources are scarce and most residues are fed to livestock or used to cover household needs. Subsequently, pressures and potential trade-offs are stronger. In sites with low cereal production and high livestock feed demand, pressures and trade-offs depend on the availability of better feed resources. Finally, sites with high cereal production and high livestock feed demand have been able to fulfil most of the demand for CR, limiting pressures and trade-offs. These patterns show that agricultural intensification, better management of communal resources and off-farm activities are plausible development pathways to overcome pressures and trade-offs of CR use. Although technologies can largely improve these trends, research and development should revisit past initiatives so as to develop innovative approaches to tackle the well-known problem of low agricultural production in many smallholder mixed systems, creating more sustainable futures. ?? 2014.},

abstract = {1. Most studies of intraspecific variation in home range size have investigated only a single or a few factors and often at one specific scale. However, considering multiple spatial and temporal scales when defining a home range is important as mechanisms that affect variation in home range size may differ depending on the scale under investigation. 2. We aim to quantify the relative effect of various individual, forage and climatic determinants of variation in home range size across multiple spatiotemporal scales in a large browsing herbivore, the moose (Alces alces), living at the southern limit of its distribution in Norway. 3. Total home range size and core home range areas were estimated for daily to monthly scales in summer and winter using both local convex hull (LoCoH) and fixed kernel home range methods. Variance in home range size was analysed using linear mixed-effects models for repeated measurements. 4. Reproductive status was the most influential individual-level factor explaining variance in moose home range size, with females accompanied by a calf having smaller summer ranges across all scales. Variation in home range size was strongly correlated with spatiotemporal changes in quantity and quality of natural food resources. Home range size decreased with increasing browse density at daily scales, but the relationship changed to positive at longer temporal scales. In contrast, browse quality was consistently negatively correlated with home range size except at the monthly scale during winter when depletion of high-quality forage occurs. Local climate affected total home range size more than core areas. Temperature, precipitation and snow depth influenced home range size directly at short temporal scales. 5. The relative effects of intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of variation in home range size differed with spatiotemporal scale, providing clear evidence that home range size is scale dependent in this large browser. Insight into the behavioural responses of populations to climatic stochasticity and forage variability is essential in view of current and future climate change, especially for populations with thermoregulatory restrictions living at the southern limit of their distribution.},

abstract = {Animals must move to find food and mates, and to avoid predators; movement thus influences survival and reproduction, and ultimately determines fitness. Precise description of movement and understanding of spatial and temporal patterns as well as relationships with intrinsic and extrinsic factors is important both for theoretical and applied reasons. We applied hidden semi-Markov models (HSMM) to hourly geographic positioning system (GPS) location data to understand movement patterns of the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) and to discern factors influencing these patterns. Three distinct movement modes were identified: (1) Resting mode, characterized by short step lengths and turning angles around 180(o) ; (2) Moderately active (or intermediate) mode characterized by intermediate step lengths and variable turning angles, and (3) Traveling mode, characterized by long step lengths and turning angles around 0(o) . Males and females, and females with and without kittens, exhibited distinctly different movement patterns. Using the Viterbi algorithm, we show that differences in movement patterns of male and female Florida panthers were a consequence of sex-specific differences in diurnal patterns of state occupancy and sex-specific differences in state-specific movement parameters, whereas the differences between females with and without dependent kittens were caused solely by variation in state occupancy. Our study demonstrates the use of HSMM methodology to precisely describe movement and to dissect differences in movement patterns according to sex, and reproductive status.},

abstract = {Projections of climate change impacts on coral reefs produced at the coarse resolution ({\{}{\~{}}{\}}1°) of Global Climate Models (GCMs) have informed debate but have not helped target local management actions. Here, projections of the onset of annual coral bleaching conditions in the Caribbean under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 are pro- duced using an ensemble of 33 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase-5 models and via dynamical and statisti- cal downscaling. A high-resolution ({\{}{\~{}}{\}}11 km) regional ocean model (MOM4.1) is used for the dynamical downscaling. For statistical downscaling, sea surface temperature (SST) means and annual cycles in all the GCMs are replaced with observed data from the {\{}{\~{}}{\}}4-km NOAA Pathfinder SST dataset. Spatial patterns in all three projections are broadly simi- lar; the average year for the onset of annual severe bleaching is 2040–2043 for all projections. However, downscaled pro- jections showmany locations where the onset of annual severe bleaching (ASB) varies 10 or more years within a single GCMgrid cell. Managers in locations where this applies (e.g., Florida, Turks and Caicos, Puerto Rico, and the Domini- can Republic, among others) can identify locations that represent relative albeit temporary refugia. Both downscaled projections are different for the Bahamas compared to the GCM projections. The dynamically downscaled projections suggest an earlier onset of ASB linked to projected changes in regional currents, a feature not resolved in GCMs. This result demonstrates the value of dynamical downscaling for this application and means statistically downscaled projec- tions have to be interpreted with caution. However, aside from west of Andros Island, the projections for the two types of downscaling are mostly aligned; projected onset of ASB is within ?10 years for 72{\{}{\%}{\}}of the reef locations.},

abstract = {1.Animal space use has been studied by focusing either on geographic (e.g., home ranges, species' distribution) or environmental (e.g., habitat use and selection) space. However, all patterns of space use emerge from individual movements, which are the primary means by which animals change their environment. 2.Individuals increase their use of a given area by adjusting two key movement components: the duration of their visit, and/or the frequency of re-visits. Thus, in spatially heterogeneous environments animals exploit known, high-quality resource areas by increasing their Residence Time (RT) in and/or decreasing their Time to Return (TtoR) to these areas. We expected that spatial variation in these two movement properties should lead to observed patterns of space use in both geographic and environmental spaces. We derived a set of 9 predictions linking spatial distribution of movement properties to emerging space use patterns. We predicted that, at a given scale, high variation in RT and TtoR among habitats leads to strong habitat selection, and that long RT and short TtoR result in a small home range size. 3.We tested these predictions using moose (Alces alces) GPS tracking data. We first modelled the relationship between landscape characteristics and movement properties. Then, we investigated how the spatial distribution of predicted movement properties (i.e., spatial autocorrelation, mean, and variance of RT and TtoR) influences home range size and hierarchical habitat selection. 4.In landscapes with high spatial autocorrelation of RT and TtoR, a high variation in both RT and TtoR occurred in home ranges. As expected, home range location was highly selective in such landscapes (i.e., 2(nd) -order habitat selection); RT was higher and TtoR lower within the selected home range than outside, and moose home ranges were small. Within home ranges, a higher variation in both RT and TtoR was associated to higher selectivity among habitat types (i.e., 3(rd) -order habitat selection). 5.Our findings show how patterns of geographic and environmental space use correspond to the two sides of a coin, linked by movement responses of individuals to environmental heterogeneity. By demonstrating the potential to assess the consequences of altering RT or TtoR (e.g., through human disturbance or climatic changes) on home range size and habitat selection, our work sets the basis for new theoretical and methodological advances in movement ecology.

abstract = {Connectivity is increasingly of conservation concern due to ongoing habitat fragmentation, land-use dynamics and climate change. Connectivity patterns result from interactions between dispersers and the environment. However, connectivity assessments often ignore responses of dispersers to matrix types or characterize matrix resistance using habitat-use, rather than movement, data. We compare conservation rankings for connectivity of forest fragments in Garo Hills, India, where matrix resistance was quantified based on (a) distance among fragments, (b) habitat use, and (c) movement constraints for the arboreal western hoolock gibbon Hoolock hoolock. We first quantified matrix resistance based on gibbon movement, in terms of gap-crossing behavior, as a function of canopy gap and tree height, which was estimated using focal scans on seven gibbon groups. Second, we estimated matrix resistance based on gibbon habitat use of major land-use types in the study landscape. We then compared rankings of forest fragments using patch connectivity indices from network analyses using these quantified matrix resistances and Euclidean distance among sites. We found that matrix resistances based on movement data suggested greater resistance of plantations than did habitat-use data. Conservation rankings based on movement data were uncorrelated with those based on Euclidean distance. Rankings derived from movement data were correlated with those obtained from location data; however, there were several discrepancies between rankings, which were explained by landscape heterogeneity in the neighborhood of fragments. Incorporating movement behavior into connectivity assessments can improve our understanding of dispersal and provide a mechanistic basis for conservation prioritization in heterogeneous landscapes.},

abstract = {1. Large herbivores play a key role in creating spatial heterogeneity through the formation of graz- ing lawns. Recent research suggests that the currently accepted nutrient-based theory on the forma- tion of these grazing lawns cannot universally explain their formation in all ecosystems where they are found. 2. We developed and investigated an alternative hypothesis on grazing lawn formation and mainte- nance based on herbivore effects on the plant–soil water balance. We propose that large herbivores change the soil water balance in grazing lawns through defoliation and soil compaction, causing a shift in vegetation composition towards a drought-tolerant plant community. 3. Investigating this idea in a tropical savanna, we indeed found profound differences in grazing lawn soil properties and water balance. In particular, defoliation increased soil temperatures and potential evaporation rates while soil compaction increased bulk density and decreased water infiltra- tion rates, especially on fine-textured soils. Soil moisture was therefore generally much lower in grazing lawns than in adjacent bunch grass areas. 4. Furthermore, we found that grazing lawn species show drought-tolerant traits, with higher leaf sodium levels, suggesting evolutionary adaptation to these herbivore-induced dry conditions. How- ever, leaf water potentials did not differ between grazing lawn and bunch grass species. 5. Synthesis. This study shows that large herbivores might form grazing lawns through previously underestimated effects on water balance. Thus, future studies on large herbivore effects on vegeta- tion should increasingly focus on additional pathways of soil compaction and defoliation. While nutrient-based processes driving grazing lawn formation may operate during the wet season in savannas, we suggest that water balance-based processes are additionally important during the dry season.},

abstract = {Systematic conservation planning aims to design networks of protected areas that meet conservation goals across large landscapes. The optimal design of these conservation networks is most frequently based on the modeled habitat suitability or probability of occurrence of species, despite evidence that model predictions may not be highly correlated with species density. We hypothesized that conservation networks designed using species density distributions more efficiently conserve populations of all species considered than networks designed using probability of occurrence models. To test this hypothesis, we used the Zonation conservation prioritization algorithm to evaluate conservation network designs based on probability of occurrence versus density models for 26 land bird species in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. We assessed the efficacy of each conservation network based on predicted species densities and predicted species diversity. High-density model Zonation rankings protected more individuals per species when networks protected the highest priority 10-40{\{}{\%}{\}} of the landscape. Compared with density-based models, the occurrence-based models protected more individuals in the lowest 50{\{}{\%}{\}} priority areas of the landscape. The 2 approaches conserved species diversity in similar ways: predicted diversity was higher in higher priority locations in both conservation networks. We conclude that both density and probability of occurrence models can be useful for setting conservation priorities but that density-based models are best suited for identifying the highest priority areas. Developing methods to aggregate species count data from unrelated monitoring efforts and making these data widely available through ecoinformatics portals such as the Avian Knowledge Network will enable species count data to be more widely incorporated into systematic conservation planning efforts.},

abstract = {Relationships between selected wildlife species and livestock distributions obtained from aerial surveys in the wet season of 1992 were examined in the southern Kalahari of Botswana. Borehole locations were used to identify main human and livestock activity. Multivariate statistics were used to analyze the influence of environmental variables, including vegetation condition and 'vegetation structure, on wildlife and livestock distribution in the wildlife core area of the Kalahari. Grass greenness and distance to boreholes were found to be the main variables influencing the distribution of larger wildlife species and livestock. Many wildlife species selected green areas. The northern portion of the southern Kalahari has a higher average rainfall and was consequently greener; a further consequence was that more humans and boreholes were found there. It appeared that wildlife species most dependent on moisture occupied only a relatively small range of available habitat, selecting the mainly unprotected greener areas but avoiding areas very close to boreholes, possibly because they are occupied by livestock and close to humans. It is postulated that increasing human impact in the wet-season wildlife ranges may contribute to a decrease of wildlife numbers in the Kalahari, especially those species highly dependent on patches of green grass.},

abstract = {Previous studies suggested an influence of human settlements on the distribution patterns of some less migratory wildlife species in the Kalahari ecosystem. This study addresses two alternative hypotheses to explain the observed patterns: habitat change caused by livestock grazing, and wildlife utilization. Relationships between selected common and less migratory wildlife species and livestock distribution were examined using aerial counts, ground counts, spoor (tracks and dung) information and vegetation surveys in a portion of the Kalahari of Botswana in a Geographical Information System (GIS). The vegetation surveys indicated effects on the vegetation up to 10 km from the livestock waterpoints. Livestock-induced habitat change appeared to have little effect on most wildlife species. All wildlife survey methods and analyses indicated the occurrence of a gap between the impact radius of livestock and high densities of gemsbok Oryx gazella, suggesting that the distribution of the latter was to be attributed to high hunting pressure resulting in displacement. It is suggested that selective wildlife utilization is a more important factor in the current distribution of common game species than avoidance of areas changed by livestock in the southern Kalahari.

abstract = {To address the ongoing global biodiversity crisis, governments have set strategic objectives and have adopted indicators to monitor progress toward their achievement. Projecting the likely impacts on biodiversity of different policy decisions allows decision makers to understand if and how these targets can be met. We projected trends in two widely used indicators of population abundance Geometric Mean Abundance, equivalent to the Living Planet Index and extinction risk (the Red List Index) under different climate and land-use change scenarios. Testing these on terrestrial carnivore and ungulate species, we found that both indicators decline steadily, and by 2050, under a Business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, geometric mean population abundance declines by 18–35{\%} while extinction risk increases for 8–23{\%} of the species, depending on assumptions about species responses to climate change. BAU will therefore fail Convention on Biological Diversity target 12 of improving the conservation status of known threatened species. An alternative sustainable development scenario reduces both extinction risk and population losses compared with BAU and could lead to population increases. Our approach to model species responses to global changes brings the focus of scenarios directly to the species level, thus taking into account an additional dimension of biodiversity and paving the way for including stronger ecological foundations into future biodiversity scenario assessments.},

abstract = {Current levels of endangerment and historical trends of species and habitats are the main criteria used to direct conservation efforts globally. Estimates of future declines, which might indicate different priorities than past declines, have been limited by the lack of appropriate data and models. Given that much of conservation is about anticipating and responding to future threats, our inability to look forward at a global scale has been a major constraint on effective action. Here, we assess the geography and extent of projected future changes in suitable habitat for terrestrial mammals within their present ranges. We used a global earth-system model, IMAGE, coupled with fine-scale habitat suitability models and parametrized according to four global scenarios of human development. We identified the most affected countries by 2050 for each scenario, assuming that no additional conservation actions other than those described in the scenarios take place. We found that, with some exceptions, most of the countries with the largest predicted losses of suitable habitat for mammals are in Africa and the Americas. African and North American countries were also predicted to host the most species with large proportional global declines. Most of the countries we identified as future hotspots of terrestrial mammal loss have little or no overlap with the present global conservation priorities, thus confirming the need for forward-looking analyses in conservation priority setting. The expected growth in human populations and consumption in hotspots of future mammal loss mean that local conservation actions such as protected areas might not be sufficient to mitigate losses. Other policies, directed towards the root causes of biodiversity loss, are required, both in Africa and other parts of the world.},

We studied the influence of land use on wildlife and livestock in south-western Kalahari, Botswana, during the wet and dry seasons. We included two types of livestock areas and two types of wildlife protection areas. Wild and domestic mammals {\textgreater}0.2 kg were sampled by distance technique. Small mammals {\textless}0.2 kg were trapped and a vegetation survey was performed. Livestock and some medium-sized wildlife species were most abundant in livestock areas, while large-sized wildlife species were mainly restricted to wildlife areas. Most red-listed species were confined to the national park. The influence of land use on abundances changed moderately between seasons. However, cattle moved into wildlife areas during the wet season. Differences in species richness and diversity were most pronounced during the dry season. The trapping frequency of small mammals was highest in the national park. Differences in vegetation structure included sparser field layer and higher cover of an invasive shrub in livestock areas. Our study shows the importance of protected areas for many wildlife species in the Kalahari. It also shows the value of a multi-species approach for investigating the effects of land use on wildlife communities. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Analysis revealed that by combining information from multiple near infrared, and short wave infrared channels, NMDI has enhanced the sensitivity to drought severity, and is well suited to estimate both soil and vegetation moisture. Typical soil reflectance spectra and satellite-acquired reflectances, are used to validate the usefulness of NMDI.

abstract = {The African protected area (PA) network has the potential to act as a set of functionally interconnected patches that conserve meta-populations of mammal species, but individual PAs are vulnerable to habitat change which may disrupt connectivity and increase extinction risk. Individual PAs have different roles in maintaining connectivity, depending on their size and location. We measured their contribution to network connectivity (irreplaceability) for carnivores and ungulates and combined it with a measure of vulnerability based on a 30-year trend in remotely sensed vegetation cover (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Highly irreplaceable PAs occurred mainly in southern and eastern Africa. Vegetation cover change was generally faster outside than inside PAs and particularly so in southern Africa. The extent of change increased with the distance from PAs. About 5{\%} of highly irreplaceable PAs experienced a faster vegetation cover loss than their surroundings, thus requiring particular conservation attention. Our analysis identified PAs at risk whose isolation would disrupt the connectivity of the PA network for large mammals. This is an example of how ecological spatial modelling can be combined with large-scale remote sensing data to investigate how land cover change may affect ecological processes and species conservation.},

This article asks two basic questions: First, do information, ally, and coordi- nation networks overlap with each other? Second, and drawing from the ACF, do policy core beliefs structure the interactions in ally, coordination, and advice/information networks? We pursue these research questions in the context of the California Marine Life Protection Act process. We find that ally and coordination networks overlap slightly more than information/advice networks and that policy core beliefs do a better job of predicting ally and coordination networks than advice/information net- works. Thus, we show that ally networks can provide a useful proxy for coordination networks to iden- tify advocacy coalitions},

abstract = {An extractive industries boom in Africa is driving unprecedented expansion of infrastructure into sparsely populated regions. Much of the investment is in high-volume minerals such as iron and coal that will require heavy infrastructure and large settled workforces. New roads and railways are being built to support these industries. Mineral infrastructure is reinforcing the dynamic of designated "growth corridors", which are increasingly determining settlement patterns and rural land use in Africa. These corridors are penetrating into areas where agriculture has been constrained by lack of access to markets. They could unleash a major expansion of arable crops in the Guinea and Miombo savannahs, tropical tree crops in Congo Basin rainforests and irrigated agriculture on the floodplains of several African river systems. Rapidly growing African cities are largely dependent on imported food but growth corridors linking them to hinterland areas could favour shifts to African-sourced foods. Governance weaknesses may allow outside investors to make land grabs along growth corridors and further marginalise poor smallholders. New pressures on environmentally sensitive areas may emerge. Policy changes are needed to avoid negative impacts of this major new development trend and to exploit the potential for poverty alleviation and food-security benefits. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

An alternative approach is to identify a suite of problems common to various types of parks and ecosystems. Such a scale-relevant approach can be applied directly to management solutions in a particular park and, more generally, to policies for managing parks in a similar ecological and regional setting. Segregation effects, a common suite of threats arising from the creation of a protected area itself, offer examples with more immediate and specific consequences than insularization effects. The approach underscores the need to identify the minimum viable processes necessary for maintaining ecosystem diversity. We suggest an ecosystem viability analysis as a suitable technique for doing so.},

The study shows the importance of discriminating human-induced changes from natural population oscillations related to rainfall and ecological factors. National park and reserve populations have declined sharply over the last 30 years, at a rate similar to non-protected areas and country-wide trends. The protected area losses reflect in part their poor coverage of seasonal ungulate migrations. The losses vary among parks. The largest parks, Tsavo East, Tsavo West and Meru, account for a disproportionate share of the losses due to habitat change and the difficulty of protecting large remote parks. The losses in Kenya's parks add to growing evidence for wildlife declines inside as well as outside African parks. The losses point to the need to quantify the performance of conservation policies and promote integrated landscape practices that combine parks with private and community-based measures.},

abstract = {Various savannaah reserves are examined to determine whether they are likely to lose substantial numbers of large herbivores if they become isolated, The relationship between the number of ungulate species and the size of each reserve is examined and compared to predictions established from existing island biogeographic studies. In the case of the savannah reserves, no significant relationship was found. However, when the data were re-analysed for reserves of similar habitat, significant though low z-values of 0.04 and 0.08 were established. For discrete ecosystems rather than reserves a steeper z-value of 0.14 was found. It is suggested that the z-value for the savannah ecosystems is lower than the typical value of 0.22 for other land mass island because of the ubiquitous distribution of most large herbivore species and their long history of co-evolution. The significance of island biogeographic theory to the design of nature reserves is limited, at least in the savannahs. Most of the variation in the mumber of species in an areas which can be practically established as reserve can be explained by habitat and landscape diversity. Whether the savannah reserves became faunal islaand will be decided by political and economic policies and practices rather than the principles of ecological design. The design of reserves in the past is considered ti have been based on sound ecological principles inmost cases, even though these were not recognized at the time},

abstract = {This paper maps the carbonate geochemistry of the Makgadikgadi Pans region of northern Botswana from moderate resolution (500 m pixels) remotely sensed data, to assess the impact of various geomorphological processes on surficial carbonate distribution. Previous palaeo-environmental studies have demonstrated that the pans have experienced several highstands during the Quaternary, forming calcretes around shoreline embayments. The pans are also a significant regional source of dust, and some workers have suggested that surficial carbonate distributions may be controlled, in part, by wind regime. Field studies of carbonate deposits in the region have also highlighted the importance of fluvial and groundwater processes in calcrete formation. However, due to the large area involved and problems of accessibility, the carbonate distribution across the entire Makgadikgadi basin remains poorly understood. The MODIS instrument permits mapping of carbonate distribution over large areas; comparison with estimates from Landsat Thematic Mapper data show reasonable agreement, and there is good agreement with estimates from laboratory analysis of field samples. The results suggest that palaeo-lake highstands, reconstructed here using the SRTM 3 arc-second digital elevation model, have left behind surficial carbonate deposits, which can be mapped by the MODIS instrument.

abstract = {Spring migration may facilitate survival and recruitment in mammals by reducing predation risk and increasing access to higher-quality forage. The Yellowstone pronghorn Antilocapra americana population ({\textless}250 animals) retains one of only two pronghorn migrations remaining in the greater Yellowstone region of the western United States. We used 5743 telemetry locations of 44 adult, female pronghorn during June 1999-August 2005 to determine migration patterns, seasonal distributions, and individual fidelity to migratory strategies. Yellowstone pronghorn were partially migratory, with {\textgreater}70{\%} of the pronghorn population migrating 15-50 km to 4 contiguous summering areas and {\textless}30{\%} remaining year-round on the winter range. Most radio-collared pronghorn showed fidelity across years to their migration strategy and summer use area, but approximately 20{\%} migrated in some years, but not others. This behavioral flexibility is consistent with the hypothesis that migration in Yellowstone pronghorn is a conditional strategy and likely contributed to dynamic and rapid changes in the proportion of migrants from 80{\%} to 20{\%} and back to 70{\%} during 1967-2005. All migrant pronghorn traveled 10 km over a topographic bottleneck (Mt. Everts) separating the winter and summer ranges, primarily using grassland-sagebrush pathways through conifer forest. We recommend continued protection of this corridor because increased mortality and a decreasing proportion of migrants may be as important a threat to the persistence of partially migratory populations as habitat fragmentation, especially when local resources for non-migrants are inadequate to sustain the entire population. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Much could be gained by more closely integrating the disciplines, but several challenges stand in the way. Goals differ, reflecting different origins and agendas. Because resources are insufficient to meet all needs, priorities must be established. Rapid environmental changes create uncertainties that compromise goals and priorities. To realize the benefits of integration, goals should be complementary, acknowledging the uncertainties that stem from temporal and spatial dynamics. Priorities should be established using clearly defined criteria, recognizing that not everything can be conserved or restored; some form of triage is inevitable. Because goals and priorities are societal concerns, conservation and restoration must include people as part of—rather than separate from—nature. A more meaningful and integrated approach will blur disciplinary boundaries, focus on outcomes rather than approaches, and use the tools of both disciplines.},

This review synthesizes and recommends best practice change detection methods for land management groups to monitor chief ecological change indicators currently monitored in United States protected areas. The indicators frequently monitored via change detection and reviewed here include: land use/land cover, disturbance, and phenology. Landsat data products are recommended for monitoring land use/land cover and disturbance, due to their continuous data accessibility free of cost since 1972. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) are recommended for monitoring changes in phenology due to its 1-2. day return interval at any given location. Best-practice remote sensing methods are stressed, such as careful validation of results, either by combination of remotely sensed datasets with high resolution imagery or in situ data, in order to increase accuracy and to better align the remotely sensed data to the scale of the on-the-ground processes. Reported results should always be presented with utmost clarity in a manner that is both applicable to managers and understood by the general public. Increased collaborations between ecologists, land managers, conservation groups, and scientists are compulsory for successful integration of remote sensing-based monitoring, which is vital for effective conservation in protected areas. Remote sensing change detection quantifies the effects of humans on a landscape scale without creating further disturbances to ecologically sensitive areas; the results of which can be used for efficient conservation management into the future.},

Contrary to predictions of this argument, we found that average human population growth rates on the borders of 306 PAs in 45 countries in Africa and Latin America were nearly double average rural growth, suggesting that PAs attract, rather than repel, human settlement. Higher population growth on PA edges is evident across ecoregions, countries, and continents and is correlated positively with international donor investment in national conservation programs and an index of park-related funding. These findings provide insight on the value of PAs for local people, but also highlight a looming threat to PA effectiveness and biodiversity conservation},

abstract = {The internal state of an individual-as it relates to thirst, hunger, fear, or reproductive drive-can be inferred by referencing points on its movement path to external environmental and sociological variables. Using time-series approaches to characterize autocorrelative properties of step-length movements collated every 3 h for seven free-ranging African elephants, we examined the influence of social rank, predation risk, and seasonal variation in resource abundance on periodic properties of movement. The frequency domain methods of Fourier and wavelet analyses provide compact summaries of temporal autocorrelation and show both strong diurnal and seasonal based periodicities in the step-length time series. This autocorrelation is weaker during the wet season, indicating random movements are more common when ecological conditions are good. Periodograms of socially dominant individuals are consistent across seasons, whereas subordinate individuals show distinct differences diverging from that of dominants during the dry season. We link temporally localized statistical properties of movement to landscape features and find that diurnal movement correlation is more common within protected wildlife areas, and multiday movement correlations found among lower ranked individuals are typically outside of protected areas where predation risks are greatest. A frequency-related spatial analysis of movement-step lengths reveal that rest cycles related to the spatial distribution of critical resources (i.e., forage and water) are responsible for creating the observed patterns. Our approach generates unique information regarding the spatial-temporal interplay between environmental and individual characteristics, providing an original approach for understanding the movement ecology of individual animals and the spatial organization of animal populations.},

abstract = {Habitat loss is the primary reason for species extinction, making habitat conservation a critical strategy for maintaining global biodiversity. Major habitat types, such as lowland tropical evergreen forests or mangrove forests, are already well represented in many conservation priorities, while others are underrepresented. This is particularly true for dry deciduous dipterocarp forests (DDF), a key forest type in Asia that extends from the tropical to the subtropical regions in South-east Asia (SE Asia), where high temperatures and pronounced seasonal precipitation patterns are predominant. DDF are a unique forest ecosystem type harboring a wide range of important and endemic species and need to be adequately represented in global biodiversity conservation strategies. One of the greatest challenges in DDF conservation is the lack of detailed and accurate maps of their distribution due to inaccurate open-canopy seasonal forest mapping methods. Conventional land cover maps therefore tend to perform inadequately with DDF. Our study accurately delineates DDF on a continental scale based on remote sensing approaches by integrating the strong, characteristic seasonality of DDF. We also determine the current conservation status of DDF throughout SE Asia. We chose SE Asia for our research because its remaining DDF are extensive in some areas but are currently degrading and under increasing pressure from significant socio-economic changes throughout the region. Phenological indices, derived from MODIS vegetation index time series, served as input variables for a Random Forest classifier and were used to predict the spatial distribution of DDF. The resulting continuous fields maps of DDF had accuracies ranging from R-2 = 0.56 to 0.78. We identified three hotspots in SE Asia with a total area of 156,000 km(2), and found Myanmar to have more remaining DDF than the countries in SE Asia. Our approach proved to be a reliable method for mapping DDF and other seasonally influenced ecosystems on continental and regional scales, and is very valuable for conservation management in this region.},

abstract = {The normalized difference water index (NDWI) of McFeeters (1996) was modified by substitution of a middle infrared band such as Landsat TM band 5 for the near infrared band used in the NDWI. The modified NDWI (MNDWI) can enhance open water features while efficiently suppressing and even removing built-up land noise as well as vegetation and soil noise. The enhanced water information using the NDWI is often mixed with built-up land noise and the area of extracted water is thus overestimated. Accordingly, the MNDWI is more suitable for enhancing and extracting water information for a water region with a background dominated by built-up land areas because of its advantage in reducing and even removing built-up land noise over the NDWI.},

abstract = {Anthropocene defaunation, the global extinction of faunal species and populations and the decline in abundance of individuals within populations, has been predominantly documented in terrestrial ecosystems, but indicators suggest defaunation has been more severe in freshwater ecosystems. Marine defaunation is in a more incipient stage, yet pronounced effects are already apparent and its rapid acceleration seems likely. Defaunation now impacts the planet's wildlife with profound cascading consequences, ranging from local to global coextinctions of interacting species to the loss of ecological services critical for humanity. Slowing defaunation will require aggressively reducing animal overexploitation and habitat destruction; mitigating climate disruption; and stabilizing the impacts of human population growth and uneven resource consumption. Given its omnipresence, defaunation should receive status of major global environmental change and should be addressed with the same urgency as deforestation, polluti...},

abstract = {Competition and compatibility between livestock and wildlife in Africa has been a point of considerable speculation, with implications for conservation. However, controlled replicated experiments are lacking. Here we report on the results of a long-term exclosure experiment in Laikipia, Kenya, in which different guilds of large mammalian herbivores have been independently manipulated since 1995. In plots from which cattle were excluded, the density of zebra dung in 2000 was on average 46{\{}{\%}{\}} greater than in control plots. This was due to differential zebra use, and not to differential rates of dung removal (by dung beetles or other factors). Vegetation data indicate that cattle fully compensate for the absence of wildlife; all plots accessible to cattle had similarly low grass cover. However, wildlife do not fully compensate for the absence of cattle; plots with only wildlife had more grass cover than plots accessible to cattle. Zebra dung density was strongly correlated with total grass cover, suggesting that zebras are effectively tracking resource abundance. There is also evidence of pair-wise competition between cattle and elephants, and between elephants and zebras. The strong competition between cattle and zebras appears to be mitigated by the presence of elephants. A significant cattle x elephant interaction on the abundance of zebra dung indicates that elephants reduce the negative effects of cattle on zebras. In the presence of cattle, elephants facilitate the abundance of zebra, apparently by suppressing resource extraction (bite rates) by cattle. The precise mechanism for this indirect facilitation is not clear, but it may be related to the demonstrated reduction in forb cover associated with elephant presence. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Resistance surfaces are often used to fill gaps in our knowledge surrounding animal movement and are frequently the basis for modeling connectivity associated with conservation initiatives. However, the methods for quantifying resistance surfaces are varied and there is no general consensus on the appropriate choice of environmental data or analytical approaches. We provide a comprehensive review of the literature on this topic to highlight methods used and identify knowledge gaps. Our review includes 96 papers that parameterized resistance surfaces (sometimes using multiple approaches) for a variety of taxa. Data types used included expert opinion (n = 76), detection (n = 23), relocation (n = 8), pathway (n = 2), and genetic (n = 28). We organized the papers into three main analytical approaches; one-stage expert opinion, one-stage empirical, and two-stage empirical, each of which was represented by 43, 22, and 36 papers, respectively. We further organized the empir- ical approaches into five main resource selection functions; point (n = 16), matrix (n = 38), home range (n = 3), step (n = 1), and pathway (n = 1).We found a general lack of justification for choice of environmental variables and their thematic and spatial representation, a heavy reliance on expert opinion and detection data, and a tendency to confound movement behavior and resource use. Future research needs include comparative analyses on the choice of envi- ronmental variables and their spatial and thematic scales, and on the various biological data types used to estimate resistance. Comparative analyses amongst analytical processes is also needed, as well as trans- parency in reporting on uncertainty in parameter estimates and sensitivity of final resistance surfaces, especially if the resistance surfaces are to be used for conservation and planning purposes},

An assessment of an annual time series of tasseled cap features indicated their utility for detecting vegetation phenological cycles. The comparison analysis showed that the temporal pattern of NBAR greenness was closely correlated with the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), while NBAR brightness matched MODIS global broadband albedos. Thresholded global NBAR wetnesses appear to relate to MODIS snow and ice presence as determined by the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI).},

abstract = {Hunting and trade of wild animals for their meat (bushmeat), especially mammals, is commonplace in tropical forests worldwide. In West and Central Africa, bushmeat extraction has increased substantially during recent decades. Currently, such levels of hunting pose a major threat to native wildlife. In this paper, we compiled published data on hunting offtake of mammals, from a number of studies conducted between 1990 and 2007 in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Republic of Congo. From these data sources, we estimated annual extraction rates of all hunted species and analyzed the relationship between environmental and anthropogenic variables surrounding each hunting rate and levels of bushmeat extraction. We defined hunting pressure as a function of bushmeat offtake and number of hunted species and confirm that hunting pressure is significantly correlated with road density, distance to protected areas and population density. These correlations are then used to map hunting pressure across the Congo Basin. We show that predicted risk areas show a patchy distribution throughout the study region and that many protected areas are located in high-risk areas. We suggest that such a map can be used to identify areas of greatest impact of hunting to guide large-scale conservation planning initiatives for central Africa},
